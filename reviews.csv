0,A must see,"You have to go here to see the City views. But be prepared for long line ups, even if you have a booking time ... which you must have unless you want a very long wait.
We went at night and the lights are super.",4.0,4.6924
1,Go to the Top. Floor 102 has the outdoor view.,"Educational and beautiful views. 82nd floor is awesome view, 102 outside is even better. Heated outdoor view and feeling the wind at that story is worth the extra cost.",5.0,4.8462
2,A Must-Do!,"One of the highlights of our trip! The staff are friendly and helpful, Jews are amazing and we went to dinner at State Grill in the lobby afterwards which I highly recommend.",5.0,4.8366
3,Such an amazing experience and view,"ItÄs an incredible sightseeing experience and also very well run, We went in Mid January and there were no lines at 1pm, you didn't ned the VIP Queue jump ticket. Great staff ad a great overall experience",5.0,4.462
4,Fantastic views,"Great experience. More than just the views. From arriving and looking at the history of the building to going on the viewing platform. A wonderful visit,",5.0,4.6632
5,"Amazing, must go high rise in NY!","Basically no queue, we entered at the scheduled time. The view is amazing an it is not only an iconic building but they have really upped their game with making upgrades in technology and it is extremely interactive! Would go again!",5.0,3.673
6,Great view of the city,"This landmark has been on my list for a while after watching sleepless in Seattle as a little kid.

The only the I would change is the amount of people allowed up at a time. It was overcrowded/overwhelming",4.0,3.1544
7,Even better than we expected!,"Booked the first slot for Jan 1st 2023. So impressed with the organisation of the entry to the building, the staff who were friendly & incredibly smart, cleanliness & of course the views. Absolutely tremendous & 2nd favourite tourist attraction in the US after Alcatraz! So worth paying the extra to go to the 102nd floor. Great photo opportunities & interesting history & artefacts.",5.0,4.947
8,"Fun, enjoyable tour.",A very memorable tour. The flow of the crowd is very well managed and the overall tour had a number of very interesting exhibits done with a very good presentation style. Of course there is also the view. Make sure to try and go on a clear day. The additional 102nd floor observatory cost extra but is worth a visit.,4.0,4.6578
9,Must see!,Wonderfully done! Very organized. We loved Rita on floor 102. Would go back again. Great view of the beautiful city.,5.0,4.9084
10,Fantastic experience,The renovated Empire State Building with the two viewing levels is much better than 5 years ago. Great work - thank you,5.0,4.7181999999999995
11,Granddaughters first trip to NYC,Empire State Building never disappoints! Not only were our views perfect but we had a view of the building from our hotel window so we saw it everyday! We especially love all the special effects and history on your way to the top. You have done an excellent job of all of it.,5.0,4.9408
12,Could be more!,"Furst impressions not great. Disorganised queuing system and the most utterly rude ‘doorman’, speaking to customers so disrespectfully. Once in, experience to 80th floor was fine. The queue to get to the 86th was nearly an hour. I gave up and asked to be allowed to exit and was questioned why I didn’t want to go up to the higher floors. Do I really need to explain myself?
I would have preferred to go to Summit One in all honesty.
Customer service needs looking at!",2.0,2.3386
13,Willy Cinzia Enea Nicolas Erich,"It was a wonderful experience, the best of our vacation in New York better than The Rock and Freedom Tower, it will be for the timeless charm of the Empire State Building, truly unforgettable, the climb to the top floor is unique; however I have to point out the slowness of access, in my opinion too cumbersome procedure and above all the poor cleaning and hygiene of the toilets a scandalous thing with what they charged me for the climb I demanded decent cleanliness and hygiene (I was with three small children)",4.0,4.8434
14,Views were amazing!,There was so much history. Everything was put together very well & informative. There was enough time to take pics & videos of the great views. Recommend going a little before it gets dark to experience both day & night time.,5.0,4.6798
15,Visit,"The Experiencie was very overwhelming..To many people in the building even though they ask you to make a reservation (date + time)..

View is amazing! Especially on the top floor!",2.0,4.5084
16,Nice view,Amazing view from the 102nd floor however the staff do not seem friendly. There should be more information about the city and surrounding building and neighborhood.,4.0,3.5792
17,Visit the Empire,"was the last time 10 years ago on the Empire. It has changed a lot, made much more modern and visual. Even when it was foggy, it was a great visit with very nice employees who even became photographers. We recommend.",5.0,4.731
18,Breathtaking views,An attraction I'd missed from a previous visit. The views are absolutely breathtaking. Well worth the experience,4.0,4.6482
19,Lovely helpful lady and great place to visit.,Excellent staff and very friendly as I took a wrong turning and exited to early so the uniformed lady on the street showed be how to get back in to look at the place again.Very interesting and lots of lovely views at all levels and even though it was busy I could still look over the buildings and down also.I did not get a timed ticket just paid for a ticket and waited in a queue for 15 minutes to get in.Lovely shop and they took pictures of you which were a good souvenir of my visit.Lovely clean and tidy restrooms.Very friendly staff especially the lady that helped me rejoin the building.,5.0,4.9244
20,Amazing building. Amazing views,Try to go when its not crowded. i braved a January day. This structure was completed in only 13 months.,5.0,2.3176
21,These tickets do allow priority access to skip queues,"Booked these tickets specifically to skip the queues. THIS DOES NOT WORK. The tickets were scanned at the Empire state building and they were not registered as priority. The guard advised 'the system is not wrong' so we had to queue. There is a queue outside, then a queue for security, and finally a queue for the lift (up and down). These tickets are not worth the money as a basic entry ticket would have given the same experience.",1.0,4.0172
22,Don’t pre book,DONT PREBOOK. THEY DON’T REFUND OR ALLOW YOU TO RESCHEDULE due to bad weather. Other viewing venues do let you rearrange. Terrible customer service and very rude.,1.0,1.3894
23,Not just a viewing deck - the exhibit is outstanding,"The last time we visited the Empire State Building it was an endless array of lines to get to the viewing deck at a very high price. Well, they have put an awful lot of thought and money behind the exhibition which now precedes the viewing deck, and you seriously won't mind the lines. The highlights for me were the multitude of movie clips that feature the majestic building (shown on a 180 screen, the photo op with King Kong model, and the 4 walled cinematic experience of the building of the bridge. All in all - 5 stars. And yes, then the views of New York when you get to the observatory are worth every penny.",5.0,3.6204
24,The highlight of my vacation to NYC,It was a magnificent. The museum on the way to the top is interesting. Your trip to NYC is incomplete without experiencing all this.,5.0,4.6251999999999995
25,Good experience,"Was the first time we visit, an amazing view although the organization was not so specific to tell us about the stops to get the 102 floor. We found the people who works there was no si kind because a lot of tourists maybe",5.0,4.3194
26,Very good experience,"Very nive explanation about the history of the Empire State Building: construction, nice exposirions, very good videos.
Exceptionnal view on top.",5.0,4.5556
27,Don't Pre Book,"Don't bother pre-booking, We prebooked and arrived 45 minutest early. They wouldn't let us enter for 30 minutes but people that where buying tickets there strolled past us!",3.0,3.4093999999999998
28,wow,"Of course this is one of the places you must go to and the view's are incredible. Check weather though as we done this twice as the 1st day was really foggy. Luckily we had got city passes and had 1 left so could go back, Great time in there well worth it.",5.0,4.7856000000000005
29,Iconic experience if a little busy...,"Went with family of varying ages just after Christmas. Everyone enjoyed it overall and of course it's an epic view from the top.

But..

Had visited a few years ago and it was a calm, pleasant experience. I'm not sure if it's just the way it is now or due to the time of year/day (probably both), but it was extremely busy. Security at JKF was nice compared to being barked at on entry here! Literally herded like cattle at a fast pace, barely any chance to take things in without being shouted at. Was hoping to be able to store a stroller, but unfortunately had to fight our way through everyone with it the whole time which was a bit of a chore.

Once in it was better, time to look at all the new exhibits about the history, etc - making the ticket price more worthwhile. Attractions for the kids to look at history, the building, the workings, etc. Photo opportunity with King Kong, well is hand anyway!

Up to the observation deck on the 86th floor and of course the amazing views. Although again it was painfully crowded, almost having to push your way for every step, and trying to keep track of 8 people (including kids) was almost impossible.

Despite the moaning, it's definitely worth visiting and experiencing - set yourself a couple of hours aside to take it all in and be prepared if it's busy.",4.0,4.986
30,Good Tour,"Great tour, well worth a visit. It gets very busy and airport style security so be prepared, but well managed.",4.0,4.6342
31,Iconic building,"We love this building, we have visited before. We had the ticket to view in the day & in the evening which was great. The views are amazing & you can see so much on a clear day. There have been some added features which added that special touch & extra security which is a good thing. Definitely worth a visit, such an iconic building, can't be disappointed.",5.0,4.964
32,So much more than the view,"Absolutely loved our visit to The Empire State and it is so much more than just the view (which is awesome).
The building itself is beautiful, art deco is my absolutely favourite era.
Your visit starts with the very interesting store of how the building was built and we spent quite some time wondering around taking in all the information. Loved the floor which feels like you a looking down the lift shaft.
I won't say to much about the lift but it is an experience in itself, the best lift ride in NY by far.
When you step our of the lift you wait in a room while you are shown a brief video and then they reveal the view and it takes your breath away.
After that you move into the main area where you can then wander at will and go where you want to see the views.
As you step out onto the open deck it reminds you of all the films you have seen this iconic area in, the binoculars, the fencing, view, its just all fab.
There is also a great King Kong photo opportunity. The experience is well thought out so visitors are spread out throughout the area looking at different things.
This was probably one of my favourite experiences on our pre Christmas trip and considering the time of year I didn't find it over crowded. All in in a super experience and one not to be missed.",5.0,4.9826
33,Certainly not an inclusive place for people with disabilities,"Don't attend if you are travelling and have a disability. I found the staff here rather rude and not accommodating to people with disabilities. Telling me to purchase an express pass at an additional cost is not making something inclusive for all and, in fact, is rather discriminating. There are a number of queue stops for ridiculous money-making photos, and you are not allowed to skip these if you do not require them. An image of a background is not a real-time moment and very fake, in my opinion. Oh, look at the time I stood in front of a background image inside of the building...ridiculous. I found the whole experience exhausting and being made to queue for pictures I didn't require just to get to the top was a joke. There are at least 3 photo stops. When i spoke to a member of staff, i got told there was nothing that they could do, and i had to wait to get past their fake picture moment. Go to other attractions that seem far more inclusive and have far better queuing systems.",1.0,1.4206
34,Poor weather avoid if scheduled fog.,"I’d love to give this 5 stars, however I can’t because of my experience. The view was terrible due to the weather. Absolutely no faults with the trip itself or the Empire State Building, literally just the weather spoiled this for us.",3.0,1.8362
35,Dream,"All that I can tell you will certainly not reflect the reality of the splendor of the United States. New york with the center park, the statue of liberty and the ampire state. and if you have a few extra bucks you can chopper around town for 100 bucks (back then) maybe more now. But one thing is for sure, you won't regret the trip. For the 86 floor empire state, we reached the top in less than 3 minutes.",5.0,4.7842
36,Missed Sunset,"Planned a time to visit while the sun was setting which cost more and missed it because they didn’t say you should arrive early to pass through the exhibits. In addition, it was really foggy so even after missing the sunset, we still couldn’t see anything once on the 84th floor!",2.0,1.718
37,disappointing,I had reservations for 5;15 pm expecting that I would enter - unfortunately we were placed in a very long queue along with people who did not have tickets - waited outside for a long time and then continued to be placed in one long queue after another. I use a cane the lines were long and exhausitng - Not sure the view was worth it - coming down the same,3.0,2.2936
38,Great views,"We went up here on Christmas Day to see the great views, it was busy as you would expect but we’ll worth it and in the evening it was great too",5.0,4.7796
39,Awesome views,We were on the fence about whether or not 2 purchase tix 2 go up and I am so glad we did!! This was an amazing experience for all of us!! I’ve seen some reviews saying they waited in a long line. We had the opposite experience. We bought our tix online ahead of time for 3:15 and we’re told to get in line at 3. We did and got right in at 3:15. Once inside everything moved quickly and we made our way thru security and moved at our own pace thru the museum areas. There is a lot 2 see b4 even going up. Once we went up we had amazing views of the city and sunset and thou crowded we were able to view from all sides on the outdoor platform. Also kids 6 and under are free so this is a big $ saver for families w younger kids!!,5.0,4.9206
40,Iain,"Excellent visit, been before and still good this time, best views of the city, been during the day and a night visit and would recommend both",5.0,4.8462
41,"Pretty view, takes at least 2 hours","If you are using the City Sightseeing pass to buy tickets, make sure to get them in advance. The only tickets available when we went to scan our passes were more than 24 hours later. Also, if you purchased the pass at your hotel, make sure to take the print out they gave you with you for your scheduled ticket time. They won’t let you in with just the ticket you get from the kiosk at the Empire State Building. We did not realize their ticket would not scan to get in and almost got turned away. It took a really long time to get to the top but the view was beautiful.",4.0,4.6844
42,Good Visit,"Had a great visit. Staff was friendly and courteous. The main entrance is not marked clearly and after going in two different entrances, we were directed to the right spot. After that, it was a great trip",4.0,4.8504000000000005
43,Interesting and fun,Going through the building there are many different museum-like areas where you can stop and learn interesting facts about the building. The Observatory itself has indoor and outdoor areas to stop and enjoy the views. Can easily spend hours here to take everything in. There was confusion on when you can actually enter the building based on your reservation time. Other than that the experience was worth it.,4.0,4.1148
44,Get the express pass!!,Get the express pass!! And make sure you tell all ushers you have it. The line to get in with regular tickets is wrapped down the block. I followed other reviewers advice and thank goodness. You go right in and right on the elevators. Normal wait once inside for elevators is half an hour. It was very crowded. Hard to get a spot to see on the 86th floor. But - not many went to the 102 and it was amazing to be in the spire. Gorgeous sunset view. But book your time about half hour before you want to be on the top. It’s a bit of a journey to get up there even w express.,5.0,4.904
45,Empire State Building,"It was very unorganized when entering the lobby with no tickets and then when standing in line to purchase tickets at an unmanned kiosk. Unfortunately, we left after hearing we couldn't purchase tickets and just walk in as the timeslot was fully booked. However, after leaving we decided to inquire about purchasing tickets online and the timeframe was readily available. Very strange to say the least. After all said, it wasn't worth the cost to get to the 86th floor. Beautiful views - once in a lifetime opportunity, but the cost didn't seem to align with the attraction and its offerings.",3.0,4.2788
46,Exploitative!,"Given the price of the tickets -- and in the realm of fairness, I'm completely turned off by the mass of people allowed in at each time slot. It's wall to wall people. Huge crowds! And the fact that we exit exclusively via the gift shop says it all. I'm totally repelled and sorry for the experience -- one that I'll never repeat!",1.0,4.2786
47,Excellent experience,"Well organized, great introductory information, fun didactic displays, excellent views, perfect experience on a 1-day trip to New York!",5.0,4.9062
48,Pricing out the average person,"Yes, the view is beautiful and the information/displays on the way up are interesting to learn about but it was hard to get over the sticker shock. The base rate is expensive enough but then they charge extra to go to the highest level and charge extra to go at sunset. Guess that's about as America as you can get.",3.0,3.0774
49,Great views,"Well organised queue system, quite a lot different to my last visit in 1988! We went up Christmas day and it was incredibly cold, there were some heaters around the outdoor viewing area and they were most welcome. Would recommend a visit!",4.0,4.6579999999999995
50,great visit!,booking ahead was critical. all the visit went really great. all the family enjoyed it. the elevator use was awesome and very well organized.,5.0,4.8334
51,Indispensable,"Although the organization is not the best, for me it was essential to visit the Empire State because it is an emblematic and historical place, it was worth it",4.0,2.2912
52,Worth it,"Excellent and worth it. An experience that is unforgettable and beyond above expectations. The view, sunset and the light's amazing.",5.0,4.711
53,Iconic Attraction A Must!,"A visit to the ESB is an essential part of deepening your understanding of America, what it was and what it is today. Take a step back in time beginning from the 1930s. The views are amazing!",5.0,4.2478
54,An Empire State Sunrise,"Despite the bitter cold from the top, Mother Nature and NYC did not disappoint with their beautiful Christmas Eve sunrise. Highly recommend for those seeking a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Five stars.",5.0,4.8622
55,fantastic view of the harbor,"Worth the trip. Subway was safe and the area clean. Elevator was interesting as it was informative going up with the history if the area, 360 view is great.",5.0,4.8462
56,Nice,Nice views and a great view of New York City from every direction. Would recommend going after sunset.,4.0,4.711
57,Night experience,"Went at night, awesome experience seeing the size and scale of New York after dark. Teenagers enjoyed standing where their favourite celebrities have stood before.",4.0,4.6251999999999995
58,ESB,The visit was phenomenal. We toured at night and the view was breathtaking. It was also not as crowded as it may be during the day. Flawless!!!,5.0,4.6014
59,Appalling customer service and organisation,"Absolutely no point in booking a time slot. They are intent on only one thing: packing you in like livestock. The queues ambled up various stairs until finally a very dense crowd (with people pushing in) assembled before the lifts. No members of staff were present to administer orderly conduct — total shambles. I felt it was bordering on dangerous. When I pointed this out to a security guard he just said ‘welcome to New York’. Classy.
If you want to go, go at a quiet time. Don’t expect the staff to be able to engage in anything beyond the most basic communication!",1.0,3.9173999999999998
60,Mom’s Christmas,My mom’s first visit and it was outstanding!! Thank you!! Annette who I’ve seen at the door is one of a kind!!,5.0,4.803
61,Christmas in Ny,Fantastic and learned a lot of its history and how it was built. Enjoyed the time we were given to read everything and rushed out.,5.0,4.569
62,So much fun!!,"Amazing place great history lesson, beautiful views!! would definitely recommend red carpet express is not necessary elevators were fast!",5.0,4.9152000000000005
63,First Trip Back in a While,"We haven't been to the Empire State Building in 7-8 years and we were more than impressed with the improvements since our last visit. The history and background they provide on the ground floor was impressive both with the presentation and the content as well. Our kids - 12 and 10 - also enjoyed it which speaks volumes. Granted, we were lucky to be there on a slow day so the crowds were minimal. The interactiveness of the experience was impressive leading to the 4 of us having an amazing visit. Not that we didn't expect that, but I'd still say it went above and beyond.",5.0,4.825
64,Rainy day,"I should be able to reschedule in case of a rainy day. I went to the top floor just to see nothing.
Total waste of money and time.",1.0,3.8552
65,Quick NYC trip,I had a couple days open before Christmas so a friend and I did a quick trip to NYC. We booked the sunset time slot at the Empire State Building and added the all-inclusive dinner package the Grill at the Empire state Building. It was all fantastic! The views in daylight then the lights at night followed by a delicious meal which was for NY reasonably priced. First time to NY for my friend and this was our first stop from the airport/hotel check in. It was so much fun and a great experience.,5.0,4.9458
66,"Great, only one minor issue","Great experience. Very little waiting after making reservations in advance. Only issue: Have to pay extra to goo by elevator from floor 80 to floor 86. Ok for our adult children and young grandchildren to walk the 6 flights of stairs, but my wife and I (both seniors) chose to decline. Perhaps have elevator to 86 floor available for seniors at no extra charge",4.0,1.7626
67,going up,just wonderful. i found the staff to be friendly and very organised. The lining up didn't take long at all. maybe put some fans on the six flights of stairs going up as a lot of people ran out of breath.,5.0,4.569
68,Empire trip,Great experience but the extra money for the skip the line was a waste. You basically navigated yourself without any help or assistance from a guide or employee. Terrible directions.,3.0,1.3048
69,New York Trip,"Excellent experience overall from stay at Hyatt @ Jersey to Metro/subway commute to all the places we visited including empire State Building, Central park, Time square, Brooklyn Bridge, WTC & Memorial site of 9/11. It was a great trip all together,",5.0,4.6632
70,Straight to the Top,"We took our 9yo niece to New York for her Christmas gift. The Rockettes and The Lion King were both entertaining; but I think the nightime view of the Big Apple from atop the Empire State Building were everyone's favorite. Light twinkling and sights visible (thanks to the complimentary tower optics on the 86th floor). But I would highly recommend paying just a few $'s more, so that you can continue your experience up to the 102nd floor observatory. NOTE: If you are pressed for time, or have young children with you, then paying for the express pass is worth skipping the lines of tourist to the top.",5.0,4.9166
71,I dont like heights,"We went up the wee fella early on Christmas Day morning 2019 and wow it was truly incredible. The views were spectacular, every side offered something from a movie and we loved it.

The crisp Manhattan air meant we could see for miles and it was a Christmas memory to savour.

Highly recommended.",5.0,4.8268
72,Really great!,Great weather so the views were fantastic. Went at 11am so minimal queues. So much busier later in the day (we saw the queues). Highly recommended!,5.0,4.755
73,Terrible,"it took about one hour and half in between elevators lines to get all the way up, and about 45 min to come down. We will not recommend this visit. Not worth the time.",1.0,2.1664
74,Outstanding!,The whole Empire State experience is fabric from start to finish! You feel like you’ve lived through it’s history! It’s a visual feast.,5.0,3.9476
75,A beautiful classic,"Our visit didn’t disappoint, from the entrance to the top, what a beautiful building. The information films and exhibits were fantastic. The staff were friendly. The King Kong photo op was brilliant and the views of the city from the top were everything I’d imagined, we had a beautiful bright sunny day and could see for miles. My husbands favourite experience of our trip.",5.0,4.95
76,1st Trip to NYC,This was my favorite part of my first time going to NYC. I highly recommend this be in your list of things to do when visiting NYC. I am scared of height but there was so much to see from the top that it made me forget that I was afraid of heights. My daughter who is 19 really enjoyed this as well because she got to see all of NYC.,5.0,4.7064
77,Incredible,"I had the express ticket at sunset and it was amazing. The view, the sunset. Seeing everything with the golden light snd then the city lighting up was marvelous. It was pretty cold up there tho. So if you plan on going during winter, dress accordingly",5.0,4.7958
78,Beautiful 🤩,I had visited as a child on a school trip but wanted to go back with my family and really appreciate it and its spectacular views. It was absolutely beautiful 🤩,5.0,4.7904
79,Wow - played to the Engineer in me,Wonderful time. Loved the section on building it. I took a photo of the hotel rate just The Emprie State Building was finished (25 cents a room). We paid $250/night for something less than nice. I loved all but the brutal cold.,5.0,3.118
80,Fun experience with fast pass except for staff,We purchased the express lane to go all the way to the top. “All you have to do is follow the red carpet”. The trip up is confusing for the express lane as NO ONE is there to assist with the express lane. The workers are rude and on a power trip and even tried to bully me into the regular line. The first observation deck is just ok. The new one is amazing and the woman up on the very top was the only nice staff member. Think we will pick a different building next time. 12/17,3.0,3.1886
81,"Our favourite tourist attraction, but too busy",We all rated it our favourite thing we did in NYC but it is so busy that it's hard to get any nice photos or really enjoy the moment. They sell so many tickets that you can hardly move up the top.. They do a good job of keeping you entertained in the queue as you move through different exhibitions and information and there's an option to take 6 flights of stairs instead of waiting for an elevator to the top. It would be 5 stars if I was able to see and enjoy the view.,4.0,4.945
82,Visits 29 years apart,The revised experience is far better than just up see and out my first visit it was merely that a trip up see the views and down now it’s a full experience that takes you into the history the building and of course what you see in the views - highly recommended but be smart go early less lines less people,5.0,4.4448
83,Great experience,"We went at sunset on Sunday, December 18, so there was a huge crowd for a weekend, sunset, and the Christmas holiday. I even heard Staff telling one another that the building should’ve had extended hours leading up to Christmas because the crowds were so big. Still, they got us all through in anin a quick, organized, fashion, and my children and I had a wonderful experience. We bought the ticket for both the observatory and the 102nd floor, and I would say it’s worth the additional time and expense.",5.0,4.7418
84,Great experience,Before going to the top there's a great museum with the history and making of the Empire State Building - also some fun photo props. We avoided the long line by purchasing timed tickets. The timed tickets are just for entering - once you get in you can stay for as long as you want. Overall an excellent experience.,5.0,4.7914
85,Empire and Kong magic,"Visited 17th December 2022. Had the Christmas bug and this just added to it. Friendly staff magnificent views, clear day with sun helped. Apart from airport type security which is obviously necessary it was an easy visit. Did the stairs from the 80th floor you need to be fit or take an occasional break. Lifts were busy but managed well, a little waiting time. Experience was a dis well worth it. Thank you ESB staff",5.0,4.9124
86,Herded like cattle,"I visited 30 years ago and it was magical. Now, despite paying a small fortune we were herded like cattle, shouted at and directed through the building. Inside was over heated and they managed to also overheat outside through too many heat lamps. Should have been amazing but we couldn’t wait to leave.",1.0,3.862
87,Amazing,"Very well organised, minimal queues. Fantastic views. Easy to book tickets, we only booked a couple of days before and got what we wanted. Informative info on the Empire State Building.",5.0,4.6714
88,Absolute chaos,Don’t bother! Ridiculously unorganised queue system coupled with rude staff (and visitors who are constantly trying to push past you!) not much of an experience as you’re basically queueing the whole time. We didn’t even bother to go higher than the 80th floor as it was a shambles. Give Summit One a go instead.,1.0,1.2632
89,Visit while on holiday over Christmas,"Both myself and wife visited here while on holiday in NYC over Christmas, this was our first time visit to the Empire State Building and was simply blown away by it, the whole experience was fantastic the view outstanding and the history on display , this is the must see attraction while in NYC 10/10",5.0,4.8462
90,The legendary Empire State Building,"I had a 6 hour stopover at NYC, coming from Nashville heading towards Singapore.

Getting the express pass is a good idea as one will skip the long queues. The view is spectacular and the staff on duty were very helpful - plus had a great sense of humour. The experience will definitely be long remembered! As such, the site visit plus a sneak peek at Times Square was just right for me. Awesomeness!",5.0,4.895
91,DO NOT PREBOOK. Bad weather? No refunds!,"Prebooked tickets as we were travelling to NYC for a week long holiday from the UK, we had booked tickets for our second day at a cost of £85.40.

Prebooking was encouraged so you don't have to wait in line to buy one at the venue, but hidden in their T&Cs is the tiny text that there are no refunds due to bad weather. Well guess what? The weather was atrocious.

Wouldn't even let us re-arrange for another time. The entire time we were told ""don't bother going up guys it's just fog"" even though we'd already paid in full. What else was I meant to do?

Luckily we also had Top of the Rock Observatory booked a couple of days later (who coincidentally DO allow exchanges/refunds due to bad weather) and the view from there was much better than would be had from the Empire State Building.

Absolute scam. Do not waste your money - TOTR is better situated and more consumer friendly.",1.0,4.8442
92,Empire State Bldg experience,We thoroughly enjoyed the visit to the Empire State Building. Our tickets were for both the day and night tours. Both tours showed the City off to its best exposure.,5.0,4.6626
93,Express Line Skips the Museum,"Two major issues: First - the express tickets BYPASS THE MUSEUM !!!!! We didn't realize this until we followed signs to express - went up to 80th observatory and was told the museum is downstairs. When I was here several years ago it was displays along the wall on the 80th - but I guess they changed it. We tried to go back down but you have to go against people traffic and it was not possible. This should be fully explained on the ticket - but of course it is not.

Second issue is the ""optional upgrade to skip-the-line"" AND 102nd deck - okey dokey - so where exactly do you exercise this option ??? I thought I bought the deluxe ticket which included everything and it was skip the line but not 102nd floor. I still don't know how to add the 102nd floor - so be careful when buying your ticket - i'm sure it's there somewhere - i just didn't see i.t",2.0,4.5782
94,The Empire State Building VIP Tour,"We had a VIP tour with Renita Edmond, and she made our visit exceptional. From start to finish Renita gave us lots of interesting facts and information about the Empire State Building, and the queue jumping was a definite bonus.

Although it was cold we had a very clear day so the sites were all crystal clear, and the outside observation deck wasn’t too busy.

Thank you Renita, and see you soon.",5.0,4.9238
95,Nice but unorganized,The people at the venue were very unhelpful and did not know we purchased an express ticket although it said express on it. Also the queues at the venue are not well organized for such a busy attraction,2.0,3.5856
96,Fabulous views from the 102nd floor!,"The Empire State Building never disappoints! The views from the 86th floor are tremendous, but it's worth the time and money to go to the very top. Pick a sunny day and it is amazing.",5.0,4.8896

98,Esb in dec,Booked this before our trip as we had siteseeing passes very well organised and worth a visit - highly recommended 👌 can go outside or inside for the views depending on how brave you are feeling and lots of info on when and how it was built etc . Properly one of the more organised of rhe viewing platforms we visited.,5.0,4.7028
99,"Rude, Unprofessional, Lack of communication","Visited Wed 15th Dec 5pm. Arrived in New York that day and this visit was first on our list. Arrived at 5pm and the person at the front asked to see our ticket and then a showed us the door. When entering, the rude lady behind the counter shouted at us that we need to come off the li e to the red carpet just like everyone else and can’t we follow instructions. I allradhed the counter and explained we have an express ticket and the instructions are to head to the dead carpet. She said “oh” yes you do have an express ticket. Then passed us on to a colleague to scan our ticket and enter via the express lane. We followed the red carpet and up some stairs. A gentlemen was at the top who told us to get off the red carpet. I showed him my ticket and he said yes you need to get off and lifted the rope for us to join the regular queue. I said why is this when we’re told to follow the red carpet. He said you don’t have a ticket for that. I explained I do and showed him again. He said oh yes ok you can come back. This was embarrassing in front of everyone. We scanned our ticket again to get through the barrier and headed to security. We arrived and another couple was in front waiting behind a rope barrier. A rude unprofessional gentlemen came over and said this line is closed and to go join the regular queue. Ourselves and the couple said we’ve paid extra for this experience so joining the regular queue isn’t express. He wouldn’t listen. He said he can’t fast track us as we’ve not queued like everyone else. But we laid double the ticket price for this privilege. I walked back to the barrier we entered and the lady there was great. She walked over with me back to the security barrier and took care and got us through. This was after giving the gentlemen a stern talking to as clearly she was not impressed with her colleague either and gave him a lesson in handling customers who paid extra. After that is was plain sailing but what a very disappointing experience. It really made us feel we’d made a mistake coming to New York because everyone inside seemed so rude. Luckily we were wrong and it was just the Empire State Staff. Would certainly not recommend to go and choose one of the other tall buildings to go up who when we visited handled it perfectly.",1.0,4.8978
100,Empire state was amazing but tripadvisor service not great,"Attraction was amazing, but was misled by description of ticket. I thought the ticket included the optional upgrade to the 102nd floor but it doesn't. We had to pay an extra $38 each!! Very disappointed.

Also tried to change the date of our trip due to bad weather but had no response from Tripadvisor and was not able to get hold of anyone.",2.0,1.2032
101,"Expensive, but in the end it was good","A bit shocked at the initial price of admission, but the overall start to finish of the visit was very well done. I was very impressed with all the upgrades/additions to building to bring the attraction up to modern technology.",5.0,4.8014
102,AM/PM was an experience,"We had the luck of good weather. So we had the AM and PM experience. The folks that handle the queues could be a bit more friendly, but other than that, we had a great time. Luckily there was not such a big crowd that day.",5.0,4.8918
103,Best views,"I was amazed by the views from the 86th floor! This building has the perfect placement to see the architecture of the city and the geography of the surrounding area. You can really see how much the area is mostly wetlands.

The interactive exhibits on the lower levels were an unexpected bonus. I loved seeing the circuits that were used to operate the original elevators.",5.0,4.8804

107,Too many people let in at the same time,"Really defeats the purpose of making a reservation for a time slot when the reality is there are no crowd control. It takes 20-30 minutes in line for each elevator to go up, and when you do go to each floor it’s crowded with visitors so you can’t really enjoy the views.",2.0,2.8456
108,Pricey but worth it for the sunset time frame.,"We loved the history, great views from both the 80th and 86th floor (we happened to get to take the stairs from the 80the to the 86th floor and we thought it was worth it to go to the 102nd floor and especially since we chose the sunset time slot.",5.0,4.744
109,WOW! The view !,"This was our first time to visit the Empire State Building. Our appt was at 4, and the process was quite smooth! It was crowded at that time but I guess we all just wanted to see the sunset because when we left the line had drastically reduced in size! Such a great experience seeing the lights from above!",5.0,4.6378
110,Unprofessional employee,"I bought the tickets for me and my husband prior to a visit a week ago and I didn’t know these were not the ones to visit the 102 floor. I wanted to upgrade it and pay the difference while I was at the 84th floor, because we really wanted to go to the top floor (and that’s why we decided to visit Empire) but one of the employees told us to get down and talk with someone. When we get downstairs they said that this person was wrong telling us to get down and that they were supposed to do the upgrade „upstairs” and now they can’t do anything and we would have to pay the full price again! Terrible experiance! Poor management!",1.0,1.1188
111,Always fantastic at night,I purchased tickets to visit at night. You will beat the crowds. The views are amazing. Pay extra to go to the 102nd floor!,5.0,4.1414
112,Long wait times and too crowded,"Despite having a ticket, it took nearly 45 minutes to get to the 86th floor. When we transferred at the 80th floor, we could either climb six flights of stairs or wait another 45 minutes for the elevator. It was very crowded and hard to get close to the balcony to see the view. If you haven’t been before, it’s a must see. Otherwise, skip it.",1.0,2.6622

118,Well organized and impressive,We are probably jaded today but I can only imagine how impressive the building was back when it was constructed. The tour was extremely well organized and the guides more than courteous. I am glad we did it but probably would not do it again it took almost one half of one of our limited days while there are so many other things in NYC that we were unable to see.,5.0,4.871
119,Amazing views,"We bought tickets at the Empire State Building, following amazing help from staff member Sharon B.
We decided to go with day/night tickets.
Views were amazing and 2nd floor had some interesting displays and fun photo opportunities.
Our preference was night time, city looks amazing with all the lights (not to mention hardly any queue).
If going during the day I would recommend trying to align your time at top with sunset....though expect there to be long queues as this is most popular time!",5.0,4.9648
120,Not worth the money!,"Why do they sell timed tickets if you have to stand in a line that wraps around the block? What is the purpose of buying ahead of time if everyone is in the same line just to get up to the front of the line and be told you have to stand in the cold for another 30 minutes because you are too ""early"". When we finally got in the building the staff was very rude. It was hard to take pictures outside because there were too many people allowed to enter at one time and we hardly got any good pictures. Very disappointed for the price we paid for our family of five!",2.0,1.3512

123,100% Still Worth It,"It was really easy to get in (not a long line), and even easier to buy the tickets from an automated machine. Crowds were very reasonable.

Even nowadays with more observation decks competing with the classic, I think this is still 100% worth it. The central location is unbeatable, and the building is just too iconic.",5.0,4.5682

126,Urgh,"Great views. Horrid staff. Booked to skip the line but it made zero difference and we were literally pushed and pulled around the building by the crowds. It’s impossible to tell if you’re in the queue to go up to the next level or exit the building. Utter chaos. Two female staff were trying their best to help the queues, all the other staff were male and they were just standing around glaring and looking resentful. One elevator broken which apparently is not unusual. Appalling set up and quite dangerous to have that many people in one place. Could not wait to get out of there!",1.0,1.429

But the view was so mesmerizing, I stayed for over an hour looking at each direction and noticing different buildings and streets and looking through the telescopes.

The museum was cute. The experience was like Disney World with everything in theme, the screens that made it feel like you were transported back in time and the employees all in costumes.

I didn't go up to the very top observatory, but I also didn't feel like I was missing out on anything. At the 86th floor, there's nothing you can't see in the city.",5.0,4.8544

137,Worst experience ever,Worst ticketing system and entrance process in the world.

Bought a new reservation for Monday. On Monday it was not possible to go half an hour before time but it was possible to buy tickets inside and entering immediately or arrive with 5 hours late… I had to wait 45 minutes with no line to be able to enter.

These go another 20 floors above and you are outside, which is neat!! Is it worth the extra $20-30 a ticket? Probably not, but it was pretty!!

It’s a beautiful building, as to be expected!! However, the staff is quite interesting, majority (almost all that we encountered) obviously do not enjoy their jobs. They were not kind. The elevator operator outside of the top floor yelled at our 9 year old daughter because she was reaching to press the elevator button (outside the elevator) to take our family and another back down. The operator was talking to another staff member, we had no idea that was “her job” and off limits to guests, that just paid almost $400 to be there. She let us know quickly it is “her job” and to get her hand off the elevator buttons! She was so incredibly rude. She kept ranting how she is sick of people bringing kids up there and letting them run all over her job…?! What? It’s a button to the lobby! You were not doing “your job,” or we would gladly have not touched “your equipment.” There were no signs. We just looked at her while she threw her little tantrum and let the doors close on “her elevator.” She was still ranting outside when the elevator took off. The other family said they too had issues and could not believe this just happened!

Another child was TOUCHING the line barrier rope for another elevator and a male operator stopped shad he was doing and loudly reprimanded him, “I shouldn’t even have to tell you not to touch that!!! Stop!” The child started to cry.
These elevator operators are something else.

Seriously, this is not okay. There was no one to speak with about this behavior. Our experience will reflect how we felt. It was bizarre!

There was one elevator attendant on the top floor that broke the mold! He was so kind and friendly, jovial!!! You need more line that incredible man that enjoys life and makes guests enjoy their experiences.

Highly recommended, the visit was a wonderful experience .",5.0,4.889
175,Magic and sparkle at night atop Empire State,"Empire State Building is an NYC classic, but it’s a must do for a reason.
What blew me away was how beautiful the art deco interior of this grand building was, not to mention the high quality period outfits worn by the staff. The attraction begins with an exhibition all about the history of this iconic building and its fascinating construction.
You are then taken to several floors of observation decks which give breathtaking views of the city, we went at night making for a magical and sparkling finale to our day.

Special mention must go to the friendly, helpful and outgoing staff that are just as passionate about this building and ensuring you have a good time as much as you are.

I highly recommend a visit and would happily do it again. We used the CityPass to combine attraction pricing across New York.",5.0,4.993
176,Excellent,"The view is amazing and it’s totally worth it! I went to the 86th floor and then to the top- 102nd floor. You can see the whole New York City and especially at the sunset or at night when all the lights are on, you can see the magic of NYC. Very nice people work there and they are willing to help anytime.",5.0,4.8332

182,The 102nd Floor is Worth It!,"Though it costs more, visiting the 102nd floor is worth the investment. It's a totally different experience than the lower observation floors and it truly gives you the peak experience you may be seeking. The 102nd floor has full glass walls and you truly feel like you are standing at the very top of the building, and you are! Go for it! It's an amazing experience and memory.",5.0,4.8514

186,Rude staff,When we got there. I was asked out side the building when my ticket time was. I said 5 pm. It was 4:30. The guy told me to come back at 5pm. I asked if we could just look around the lobby. He said yes..at 5pm in a very rude voice. We came back at 5 and went in. I then asked were do we go for the VIP tour I paid extra for. I was told just follow everyone else. We got to the first ticket scanner and was told there is a problem with our tickets. That they printed out for the wrong day and that this had happened 4 other times that day. They said the would get us in stil but we would have to wait 45mins. I asked why? That I paid extra for the sunset view time. I was told nothing could be done and we would miss it. Even though the lobby was empty. So we wait against the wall as we were told to and my girls sit down on the floor. I man in a suit came out of a door and told them to stand up because sitting was not allowed. I laughed thinking he was kidding. Nope…he was not kidding. I then asked why and was told because it’s the rules. So I asked about the stranger things VIP tour package I purchased and where do we go for that. I was told that it had ended in October. I asked why did I pay extra for something that is not here now. I was told sorry but there is nothing we can do. When it was time to go in. I was told to go on the red carpet to start our tour. It then after starting. I was told by staff to go else where. There was no VIP tour. Staff continued to be rude and disrespectful to not only me but other people as well. I paid just under $500 for three VIP tickets that had the same experience as normal tickets. No difference at all. Plus no stranger things exhibit and no vip waiting room or tour. Yes…the view is amazing. But do not fall for the vip scam. If you go. Just buy a normal ticket. I am glad my girls got to see the view of the city. It next time I will spend the extra $200 and just do a helicopter tour.,1.0,4.8436
187,Definitely worth visiting,I visited the 86th floor at 4pm on a Thursday and it was a great experience. Wasn't very crowded. The city views during the sunset were exceptional. The visual exhibits were very impressive.,5.0,4.6536
188,ESB in November,The museum area was interesting. The special effects on the elevator rides were fun. The views were spectacular. The entire staff were helpful and friendly. I think the price must be prohibitive for many visitors.’,5.0,4.8574

190,Overcrowded overpriced,"Overcrowded, poorly organized, the top observatory was especially crowded considering it was a sealed tiny room and a population of unmasked strangers. Further the view is about equivalent to the main observation deck. The glass elevator is essentially laughable as its view is the inside of an elevator shaft. Paid 100 each at the end of the day and and would have love to spent that on a restaurant or a show.",1.0,4.4702

192,Empire state,"Great views from the top , cold and windy , but outside heaters on one side , all rhe staff were helpful, no waiting, definitely worth the visit, bit pricey for a trip in a lift",4.0,4.7348
193,Stunning views of New York! Definitely worth going to the top,"We booked a ticket to go to the Empire State Building and so experienced the views as the sun went down and the lights came up. Initially we just purchased a standard ticket but upgraded to go up to the 102nd floor whilst we were there and it was definitely worth the upgrade, just wished we had purchased it all in advance.
Would definitely recommend anybody visiting to purchase a ticket that includes floor 102 as the views are amazing.",5.0,4.9155999999999995
194,Not as good as expected,"Booked standard timed tickets without the skip the line option for 86th floor. Turned out to be a good choice as almost no line at all.

Security check was really outdated. Reminded me of an airport 15 years ago. Having just visited Edge observatory 90 mins earlier, I found the approach here pretty slow and cumbersome.

The staff were a bit hit and miss in that some were cheerful and some were as miserable as I’ve ever met.

Being forced to walk through the museum before getting to the 86th floor was pretty frustrating. Sure there’s lots on interesting things to see but I was there for the views.

The views were great though and made the visit worth it.",3.0,4.8304
195,Brilliant as usual,Had a great time. Staff very helpful. Not busy so no long queues. Always worth a visit when in New York,5.0,4.4746
196,Empire experience,The entire Empire experience was memorable. We went up at sunset…amazing! We stayed until dark on 102nd floor. Highly recommend!,5.0,4.0462
197,King of the Hill,"We've been coming here since the early 1990's, took family photo at the top of the WTC building looking down to the street below through the glass floor. The ESB visuals are breathtaking, we went just after sunset and it was fabulous. Do not do this event without going all the way to the 102nd floor. It's expensive but I'd give it a 10. It's well organized, the building is opulent and the staff is okay. They have a lot of visitors to deal with.",5.0,4.645
198,Breathtaking,"We had a great afternoon in the Empire State Building! We got lucky and booked in early afternoon so it was pretty quiet, basically walked right in.

Staff were great at keeping us going in the right direction and views up the 86th floor didn’t disappoint!",5.0,4.8476
199,Empire State Building at night in November,"This is the second time we have been up at night and you cannot rival the views, they are amazing and worth seeing. However, this will be the last time we do this. The attitude of the staff was appalling this time. The doorman was rude when we arrived and the staff throughout the time we spent here was poor with bad attitude and loudly talking about there personal lives in front of customers.",3.0,1.4988
200,great view,"I really enjoyed this visit, I got to enjoy the view of the city. I would definitely recommend this, but come early if you want to get a better view at night.",4.0,4.7666
201,Best View of NYC,"Atop the Empire State Building, you can see a city in constant change, just as it was in the 1930s when the building was built. The experience begins long before you take the elevator to the 86th floor. It creates an immersive experience that should not be rushed in order to ascend to the top of one of the most famous buildings in the world. The only ""downside"" of the experience is the cost. That elevator ride is far too expensive for a family. Yes, it IS a one-of-a-kind experience, but only for the wealthy.",5.0,4.4454
202,Excellent start of the day,We debated whether to buy tickets to skip the line and whether to go around 2pm or when they opened. We decided to buy regular tickets to go up to the 102th floor and see exhibition in between and we went for 10h15am on a Saturday. It was the best decision. There was no line really. The exhibitions were awesome and we were able to take photos inside. We took our time. Although it was windy on one side at the 86th floor we enjoyed it nonetheless. The view was breathtaking from the 102th floor. I would redo again but this time at night to enjoy it differently.,5.0,4.8002
203,A wonderful experience,"We had a wonderful visit. We went to floor 102 but honestly there is really no need. The 86th floor is the main attraction. We went in the evening (well after the sunset crowd) and there was no crowd at all. I am happy I didn't spend anything extra on a skip-the-line ticket because we didn't need it at all. (but if you go when it is crowded, then you'll probably want it!) The elevator operators and other staff were very nice.",5.0,4.8826

206,"Classic, engaging attraction","Upon watching and reading reviews of which tower / high rise experience to go on in NYC, many put the Empire State Building at, or near, the bottom of the list. It is true that it's hard to get that iconic view of the ESB in the background when you're AT the ESB. However, the exhibits throughout the experience prior getting onto that world-famous observation deck, is very informative and provides so many insight to how the ESB was built, its history and lore, as well as its cultural impact in movies, TV, and theatre. This is definitely something many, if not all, of the other towers don't have to offer. It definitely surpassed my expectations. Definitely still an attraction to go experience and enjoy if you're ever in NYC.",4.0,4.9002
207,fantastic view,Unbelievable how quickly Empire State Building was built up. I have my respect and the 360 degree view over New York is just fantastically indescribable. I will gladly come again!,5.0,4.5288

209,Go there only if you plan to go up,"We did not plan to go up. However, you must see the Empire State, so they say. We went there in an extra trip, outside our planned tour. It was very disappointing to us. When you stand there, you do not see anything!! not the building itself",2.0,1.7558

Other than that, this was a great experience.",4.0,4.0046
215,Sunset @ the Empire State Building,"This was my 13 yo son's first visit to NYC. He chose what he wanted to see and the ESB was a top choice. It did not disappoint.

Highly recommend.",5.0,4.7284
216,Great Views and Great Staff,We got lucky and were able to go up ESB on a clear day. We went first thing in the morning (10am) and it wasn't too crowded.

218,Night time experience,"Wow what an amazing experience! We loved how interactive this was from the moment we arrived. The build up to the actual view point is just as good! The King Kong feature was very fun. The view of a night time is amazing and we loved it. The only negative I would have was our ticket was for 9pm but we were asked to leave the observatory by 9:30pm as it was closing which was not stated prior to our visit. I would also have liked to have visited the gift shop but this was closed, I feel this should be clearer if you are booking an evening or later ticket.",4.0,4.926

222,A Shining Gem,My husband and I did the VIP guided tour as my birthday date. As a native New Yorker I have wanted for years to do this special tour. It was better than what I had imagined. We were escorted through the experience by VIP Ambassador Renita Edmond. Neither the Empire State Building or NYC could have a better ambassador. Her knowledge of the history and culture of the building and its times is amazing. Her passion and pride in her work and the building make her a gifted professional and one of New York City's shining gems. She made this a truly special and personal experience for us. Thank you Renita. We'll never forget this. Isabel and Bob,5.0,4.9762
223,Visiting the Empire State Building,"As a native New Yorker, I never cared to visit the Empire State Building during the 25 years I was there. But I left for 10 years and visited with my girlfriend. I took her and was blown away by the experience. I should've went sooner!",5.0,2.5198

230,"Amazing attraction, some of the staff need to learn basic manners.","I would’ve given it 5 if it wasn’t for the rude staff members I encountered. We were all shouted at by the “gentleman” who was supervising the gate entry like we were pieces of dirt and he was a Sergeant Major. Totally unnecessary and extremely patronising. The lady in the gift shop had no manners whatsoever either, she didn’t utter a word throughout the whole transaction. It spoilt it for the rest of the staff who were really lovely. The attraction itself is amazing and a bucket list tick for me. I used my New York Pass with ease.",4.0,4.8184000000000005

We went to 80th and 87th floors. 80th floor inside and the views were good, but a bit obstructed by the walls between the windows. The views from the 87th floor, that's outdoors, was much better but instead somewhat obstructed by the fence. Still a amazing experience with breathtaking views especially towards downtown Manhattan.
As we went to Top of the Rock as well, we felt that TotR was better as You could see the ESB from there.
When we visited there where absolutely no queue. Be prepared that if it's crowded, the long walk through the museum up to the elevators can take forever.",5.0,4.9518

Magnific building with the explanations.",5.0,4.0212
236,WOW!,"I actually choked up with tears when I went through the exhibits. To be in such an iconic place - so many movies made there, so many dreams dreamt there - and the history: all those incredible workers who knew building the ESB was a real opportunity. Their courage and labor was inspiring. Then of course there is the view. I could not believe how big NCY actually is and seeing the autumn leaves in Central Park was superb. I bought a King Kong TShirt, Empire Dreams Glass, a Christmas tree decoration and some chocolates for friends. The quality of the merchandise is great. The staff are absolutely wonderful. All throughout the building, they are knowledgeable and helpful. It was a magical experience. This really is the most wonderful skyscraper on earth - it has character and history - just like an old friend",5.0,4.9786
237,First Time Visiting in 10+ Years,I went back when it was still just the original Lobby and elevator. The new observation deck and history displayed all over the 80th floor really adds to the experience. It was really great and fancy!,5.0,4.591
238,ONLY for the able-bodied,"Went with my husband because it was on his bucket list, paid for the express passes and second viewing deck. When the line started forming outside, I had to go ask the employee manning the line entrance about my express pass deal, and we still had to wait outside, just at the front of the line instead. Here's the deal-- I'm partially handicapped. I can walk, and stand, but NOT FOR LONG. I thought paying so much extra for the express passes would facilitate my being able to do this, but it really DID NOT. I was already in pain before we were even allowed inside. And there was SO MUCH WALKING and NO PLACE TO SIT AND REST until you get to the first viewing deck. At one point I had to duck into a restroom just to sit for a minute. They REALLY need to offer wheelchairs for people like me who simply cannot stand for that long. By the time we reached the lower viewing deck all I could do was sit and wait for my husband to drink it all in. Then we went to the new deck on 102 and there was no place to sit there at all, so I just left him there and went back down to where I was sitting before. And I had to rush past the gift shop, where I happily would have spent way too much money if I hadn't been in so much pain, and hide out in another restroom to wait for my husband. I would not recommend this for anyone with a spinal condition unless they arrive with their own wheelchair. It really tainted my day, along with my wallet.",2.0,1.2808
239,Great experience but unfortunately too foggy to see much!,"Had booked our date/timeslot as part of our CityPass ticket (which all worked well).
On arrival there were still some queues to get in and up the lifts but it wasn't too bad and there was an interesting historical display on the way.
Once up we walked all around the 86th floor although unfortunately it was too foggy to see very much but that was hardly their fault!
We had planned to go back for the night visit but didn't as it was still foggy in the evening.
Interestingly a couple of days later we had our timeslot for Top of the Rock but when we got there we were told that there was no visibility again but we could change our timeslot to later in the day at the reception desk, which we did (no quere there either!)
It was a shame Empire State didn't give us this option but we still got fantastic views from Top of the Rock when we went hack later in the afternoon so that more than made up for the lack of views at Empire State.",4.0,4.367

The NY lady who shouted ""OMG!"" said it much better than me so thank you for summing up my delight/shock, haha!

248,A must do when in NYC,"No trip to NYC is complete without a visits here.
We last came 20 years ago & this time was so much better… now the entrance is to the side (make sure you pre book as you walk right in at your time slot, no long queues) & there is a visitors experience exhibition as you make your way to the elevators (last time was in at main entrance & straight up to observation deck).
Also to add we got our tickets via CityPass & the day we had booked woke up to thick fog, the CityPass allows us to cancel
Our booking & re-book for 2 days later without any fees or fuss (result for us as when we returned was perfect blue skies).
This time was so much better with some great things to see & experience even before you head up for the views.
All the staff are uniformed & so polite, adding to the sense for something special.
Once up on the observation decks the views were breathtaking - a real must do for any visitor ! 100% recommend this.",5.0,4.9072
249,Must go!,The views here are amazing. You can see all around the beautiful city. We went during the day and it was simply stunning. It wasn't too busy around 11am and we were able to walk the whole way round the top of the building without pushing or shoving anyone out the way.,5.0,4.8044
250,Sky High,"No guide but was fun. Amazing at night. Go all the way to the top, floor 102. Was very windy at night so dress warmly.",5.0,4.8904
251,"It was ok, the staff wasn't really helpful when we had a little hiccup with our tickets. And we couldn't really enjoy",It was really foggy & windy so we couldn't see the view... The only things we saw was clouds because of the weather! Wish we could've seen the view!,1.0,4.016
252,Well worth a visit.,"Spectacular views of New York at night, very windy on the 86th floor. Pleasant and helpful staff and very interesting exhibition on the construction of the building.",5.0,4.6878
253,Foggy but good,"Due to the foggy weather, the attraction was not crowded. Once up on the observation decks, we found a break in the clouds and were able to get a few pictures.",5.0,3.9176
254,Empire State Building to the top baby,Excellent views - a bit pricey but this is NYC. Staff generally very nice and efficient. Nice area of town to walk around in prior to visit.,4.0,4.8716
255,There was no view,We bought our tickets in advance but because of the fog there was no view. I asked if I could rebook my tickets so I could come back another time but this wasn't possible. So we went up anyway. The fog was so thick it was unable to see anything.,1.0,2.157
256,City views,"Although it was a windy, grey, rainy day the views from the top of the Empire State building were breathtaking. Lots of colourful information throughout the journey towards the observation deck. Loved King Kong section - although there was a lengthy queue to have photos taken with him so we didn't bother. Loved the lift ride to 80th floor - quick and smooth! Would definitely recommend a visit, even though it was quite expensive (even for New York!)",4.0,4.9234
257,Worth it,Must see attraction in New York. See the wonders and great engineering. Must get the 102nd floor tour as well.,5.0,4.6962
258,So worth it!,"This was an experience of a lifetime! Upon arrival at our ticketed rubbed, it was so organized. The indoor viewing platform filtered by the outdoor viewing platform both provided excellent opportunities for breathtaking views and selfies! We were so glad that we included this tire as part of our NYC vacation!",5.0,4.866
259,"Great experience, not to be missed.",Be prepared for airport type security checks when entering. Fabulous photographic displays. Staff are (after initial entry) charming. Obviously steeped in history.,5.0,4.777
260,A true high - light of a memorable holiday.,An amazing experience this trip at night up such an iconic building. It was expensive but another not to be missed experience watching the setting sun from what was once the tallest building in the world!,5.0,4.2308
261,Simply wonderful!,"We visited the ESB at 9 p.m. on our first day in New York. It was a cloudless night and we had a fantastic view of the illuminated city. The air was warm and pleasant - it was just wonderful, an experience never to forget. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the top of the Empire State Building.",5.0,4.9112
262,AM/PM Visit,"We had a one PM lunchtime visit for daytime view, it was not very busy and then went for a nigh time view any time after 8pm. The visit at 20.15 was busier but still enabled us to walk freely around the building and viewing areas. Good security and an interesting historical display. Definitely recommend the AM/PM ticket and lunchtime is a good time to miss the queue for the daytime entry.",5.0,4.9506
263,A view to remember,Highly recommend seeing the amazing view from the top of ESB. Great friendly service and barely any lines.,5.0,4.8804
264,Bit pricey,Great views of the city. Highly recommend doing it at night. Its a shame it was so expensive to upgrade our tickets to go to the 102nd floor. It was nearly $71 to upgrade our tickets on top of the £151 I had already paid.,4.0,4.3602
265,Better Than Ever!,"I first went to the ESB observation deck in June 1987, and again in 2008 - most recently Oct 2022 - it just keeps getting better. Three observations: (1) The Staff: without exception ALL were friendly, engaging, helpful and just nice to encounter. Kudos on the entire team seeming to have a sense of purpose to make each guest's visit a memorable one. (2) Waiting Lines / Areas: first, maybe it was the day we went of the multiplication of other options for observation decks, but the line (unlike in 1987 and 2008) was virtually non-existent - we practically brieezed through - or would have, except ESB has really put some thought (and investment) into the many different historical and contemporary displays along the way. Informative and entertaining - bravo! (3) Unparalleled Experience: look, I get it, there are competing high level observation decks around - BUT THIS is THE Empire State Building! It's an icon of architecture and design, history, and filmography - I haven't been to the others, but just don't see how they can hold a candle to the experience ESB offers. Just a GREAT outing - so glad we decided to do it again after 14 years away!",5.0,4.958
266,"Amazing views, iconic sightseeing stop","You have to visit at least one skyscraper in NY and what better one than the Empire State Building. It was pricey $200+ for a family of 5, but had to do it for a first time visit to NY. Plus the friends we were with got engaged 15 years ago there. We had tickets for the 9pm visit and we were late and missed it. So sad and disappointing, but we called the next day and were able to use the tickets the next night. So it turns out your QR code will scan whenever! We used the same tickets and everyone got it. Plus no one ever really checked adult/kid so you could get all kid tickets and save $$. Views were amazing.",5.0,4.3528
267,A New Yorker's Review,"I live in NYC and have not visited the Empire State Building for 10 years. WHAT A CHANGE!! The technology additions made the visit so very enjoyable!! I took my daughter and her fiance and they were so impressed! We spent a lot of time at the exhibits before going up to the 80th, 86th and 102nd floor. The exhibits were magnificent and cutting edge. Thank you for updating these! So very interesting! Also, I had not been to the 102nd floor before, and it was definitely something I would recommend. I could not believe how small it was up there! I was not expecting that! The line to get in with the timed tickets was very efficient. It moved in right on time and I was again very surprised. Very efficient and the employees and staff were so friendly. Thank you for a wonderful visit!",5.0,4.982
268,Epic,The view was amazing. Our visit to the Empire State Building far exceeded our expectations. We enjoyed the nod to King Kong. The building was clean and beautiful. Highly visiting!,5.0,4.8648
269,Perfekt at night,"It was now my third time at the Empire State Building and I love it.
I would recommend to go at night, because you have a beautiful view over the whole city and at day go to the edge or to the one world center.:)",5.0,4.782
270,Brilliant views,My husband and I accidentally purchased the AM/PM ticket but it was a happy accident as we got to see the amazing city by day and by night. We both really enjoyed the views and the inside of the building was beautiful as well. Bonus: staff was very friendly and helpful.,5.0,4.9762
271,Breathtaking views. Fabulous experience,"We bought tickets for 86th and 102nd level viewing and so.pleased as both were excellent! All staff were friendly making it a positive and happy experience. While on 86th level observation deck thunder clouds rolled in. Staff efficiently moved everyone indoors to safety. We were delighted to watch the storm complete with lightning, flash floods and a rainbow!! You have the opportunity to visit 86th level again after exiting 102nd level. Ypu exit via the shop but are not pressured into making any purchases. The views are stunning! Definitely a must do attraction.",5.0,4.9597999999999995
272,Fantastic experience,"We saw the sunset over New York. It was fantastic. There were a lot of visitors, but not more, than we had a good experience.",5.0,4.4622
273,Great view – but allow plenty of time to actually see it!,"I booked the first session of the day figuring that would be the quickest way to get to the observation deck. Nevertheless, arriving about 10 minutes before opening, the line was already long and out the door. It seem to take forever to get upstairs, then through security, then (because I had limited time) moving quickly through the museum section and finally getting to the elevator. All up about 45 minutes before I got outside. So yes, do this – the view is well worth it – but be prepared for long lines and slow progress.",4.0,4.7036
274,Packed,"I love the Empire State Building but was really disappointed this time as it was so busy. It was packed up there, we had to squeeze through people and there were security guards telling people to move on. I went 12 years ago and there were just a few up there and space to wonder and take photos.",3.0,3.057
275,Amazing views,I visited here for a New York view. So beautiful and so amazing NYC view. Recommend to everybody visiting here.,5.0,4.7905999999999995

278,New York break,Visited the Empire State Building late afternoon to capture the sunset over New York. It didn't disappoint great experience went up to the 86th floor and then onto the the 102nd. Got some great photos of New York at sunset. We booked the tickets online they came out at around $97 each to go right to the top 102nd floor against $77 for the 86th floor.,5.0,1.9062
279,Wonderful,I was last in NYC 50 years ago as a child and the Empire State Building is all I remembered so returning for a visit was a must. The whole experience is now longer and more involved and we found it very interesting. We went at night and the crowds were not to bad . The views are AMAZING and leaving through what used to be the entrance was a lovely memory. There are a few observation deck options in NYC but the Empire State Building is an icon not to be missed.,5.0,4.7126
280,On Schedule - Tick the Box!!,"We purchased tickets in advance & on line - somewhat risky with changing weather. But super easy. We were lucky, beautiful day and we were in line 10 minutes before our ticketed time. Signs and directives could've been more clear but ushers walking around clarified and directed later timed ticket holders to return to the line closer to their actual time. Definitely a must do in NYC more impactful with just a short overview of NYC geography.",5.0,4.9612
281,Viewing from above 4 Corners of Manhattan,"Pro : Splendid views of day and night Manhattan life and buildings. Good for photos
Con: long line of waiting even I had scheduled my visit time; 45 minutes waiting.
For this reason, 4 stars was given instead 5. Improve waiting line.",4.0,4.725

284,Great building,Went at night - really enjoyed. Gorgeous building. Booked in advance and used go city pass - all pretty straightforward,4.0,4.8032
285,Beautiful views,I really enjoyed seeing the NYC skyline at dark. It allowed you to see all the beautiful buildings lit up. You miss a few things that are not lit up and would be hard to see during the day anyway. The process for getting into and out of the building was efficient and safe.,4.0,4.8082
286,"Fab views, gorgeous staff.",We really enjoyed our visit and it was made better for the amazing staff working there. In particular I want to mention the lovely lady who was managing the lift to the 102nd floor at 3.30pm on Tuesday 18.10.22. I gotcha :),5.0,4.909
287,Worth it with yet a recommendation,"It’s totally worth it to go up there but don’t book the sundown times. It’s wasted money, because until you up there, there’s no more sunset to see. You can try the first time in the row but it’s still a tight schedule to get up there.",4.0,1.4836
288,Fabulous views and exhibition,This is definitely not to be missed. The exhibits are very well done and the views from the top were amazing. We went back at night and it’s hard to say if day or night was best- definitely do both. We even saw a proposal happen during our night visit ! Excellent souvenir shop too.,5.0,4.937
289,It’s is good but the service could be better.,"I bought what I thought was a Sunset Time with an upgrade to the 102 floor observation and skip the queues. I was told to line up with everyone else on a couple parts of the tour. Wouldn’t recommend to pay to skip the lines it doesn’t work. Thought I had bought the upgrade and that was on my ticket to 102 floor. Wasn’t allowed up there because according to them I didn’t have the correct ticket. Showed them what my ticket said and was told not there problem as I bought the ticket from Trip Advisor.
The view is amazing and if you go at Sunset it’s even better.",3.0,4.7534
290,Top experience,The visit was done in the evening. The access went smoothly. The views on the 102nd floor were fantastic—the ticket upgrade from the 86th floor - was worth every dollar.,5.0,3.4526
291,AWESOME,"Beyond the words ! This is the most important experience to me in NYC.
The baby was sleeping so we have enjoyed the 102 floor view completely.",5.0,4.4277999999999995
292,Amazing,"Nice employees and very helpful.
The vieuw is amazing, most spectacular.
You can stay all day long upstairs.",5.0,4.731
293,Great experience,"Well,I am Very Late in leaving a response. Infact! I am almost 3 years late.
I am leaving a late response only because I did Not think We would be going back again during Christmas Season.
My wife and I did do the Empire State Building with the higher option to go to the highest location.
We were on the elevator to go to the higher level. It was my wife and I and about 10 other tourist.
Then,while we were in the elevator.the Elevator ""jumped"" or something. All I know is we weren't moving.
Long store short. After about 30 minutes.We had to be rescued by the Fire Department. They climbed into Our elevator from the top,and placed a ladder for all of us to climb.
we ended up climbed through the top of the elevator and into the skeleton of the building. I am Sure 99% of New Yorkers Never experienced that adventure before.
All in all.It was an Experience that we will Never forget. It was like a scene from a movie being made in New York.
They gave all of us small gifts and tickets to come again.
So,I did not ever use those tickets. I no longer have them.
And,it turns out,We are going again to New York for the Holidays.
Only this time,We are taking our 2 girls who are 25 and 21. It will be their 1st time in New York. :)
And,they want to do the Empire State building as well.
So,New York!!!! Here We come .........Again.!!!
Not sure If they will Honor those two lost tickets......But, I hope so.",5.0,4.8766

Great design. Crystal clear directions. Knowledgeable staff. A lot of information and beautiful multimedia (King Kong panorama for the win).",5.0,4.9190000000000005
303,Excellent experience,"We have really enjoyed our experience, have been to 86th floor at sunset, 6pm, and loved every minute. The building is superb, and the views from the top of the building are definitely worth seeing. I would suggest the management to reduce the number of people allowed at one time, as it was very busy at the top and difficult to take photos. Also, the price is a bit high.",5.0,4.897
304,The 102nd floo!,"This was my second trip to the ESB. This time I got to go to the tippy top.
The building itself is so beautiful, as is the amazing views.
The staff is nice and helpful.
Traveling through the building to the observatory, they entertain you. Photos, displays, art, and a great elevator show.",5.0,4.941
305,Do not book through Trip Advisor,I booked this trip through Trip Advisor at 8.30 for the same day at 11.30- the tickets were not delivered by email and I can’t find a way of getting my money back. Since it was over 250 usd I am extremely unhappy.,1.0,2.0492

317,WOW!,Visited the Empire State Building 26 years ago. Many changes have been made (plus implementing more security measures) since then. Much more has been added.,5.0,3.801
318,Nice but not sure about value,"Our ticket/voucher from Trip Advisor was not accepted at the terminal. We had to wait and work with the ticket office to print tickets. Then had to convince we bought the skip the line/plus 102nd tour. My voucher via the Trip Advisor website spelled out our purchase. The facility seemed to handle the best way they could. I think this was more of an issue with the instructions from Trip Advisor. Regardless of this inconvenience, the night time views were amazing. Went at 7pm. Clear night. Would have liked a guide to say what to look for from each area. Outside deck was nice. Extra cost for the 102nd floor was nice, but not sure I would do it again. It was inside and small and not near as crowded so you could study the sites. The operator on this floor was very knowledgeable and friendly. Wonder if there was a tour with a guide to learn about the history/facts of the building - would have been better value. One of the most expensive attractions we did. My teenage sons really liked it though. Finally, getting tickets ahead of time did save a lot of time. The walk up line was crazy long.",4.0,4.963

321,Took the Guided Tour,"My wife and I only had an evening to enjoy the highlights of NY, NY before sailing out of Brooklyn the next morning. Had to visit ""The Icon"" so we took the guided tour. This was 90 minutes of personalized attention to the building's heart and history. I knew of the incident in the 1940's when a bomber crashed into the building so we got to visit the floor (currently vacant) and get the guide's account of that day as well as a secret or two. For those who enjoy a little historical background this tour was well worth it.",5.0,4.777
322,Top of the World!,"This was an experience, but alas it was cloudy and raining when we went, but so worth it.

332,Awesome experience in NYC,We visited Empire State Building during a recent trip to NYC by using our Go City passes which gets you admission to the 86th floor observation deck. There has been a total renovation since my last visit and it looks fantastic. Be sure to make your reservation ahead of time and have it with you upon arriving at the entrance. There were several staff members that checked our reservation time. All of the staff members were professional and courteous throughout the entire visit. We thoroughly enjoyed our time on the 86th floor and we opted to purchase the upgrade to visit the 102nd floor. The observation deck on 102nd floor was also renovated and now has floor to ceiling windows with stunning views of the city. The staff member was so kind and took some spectacular pictures of us with the city in the background. This was definitely a highlight of our entire trip.,5.0,4.9492
333,"Spectacular view from 80th, 86th and 102nd floors!",Every team member at the Empire State Building are friendly and truly happy to assist. They are very knowledgable about the ESB as well as surrounding landmarks. It was my first visit even though I've been to NYC several times. Highly recommend!,5.0,4.8646
334,Great and Memorable Experience,"We had purchased our timed entrance tickets well in advance, so we were able to enter easily and at the time we wanted. The security was thorough, but quick. The 2nd floor exhibits were informative and varied -- we were able to stay as long as we wanted in areas that interested us and walk on through others that weren't as of much interest to us. The process to enter and exit the elevators to the Observation Decks was well-organized and smooth. Our teens were nervous about going up, but the elevator ride was fun and put them at ease (I won't give that away). Once we were on the upper floors, their nervousness changed to excitement as they could see places we had visited and places we were going to visit. It was a clear day, so we had great visibility. We were able to stay on the 80th and 86th floors as long as we wanted. (We did not go to the 102nd floor.) The staff were all friendly, directing us and answering questions. It was a great and memorable experience!",5.0,4.9826

The view from the top are defienetely awesome, the NYC skyline just keeps impressig you. We loved it.",4.0,4.8658

339,Poor customer experience,"Having visited 7 years ago I was looking forward to visiting again but in the evening to see the city after dark. The view is still as good as I remember but the rest of the experience was poor. Having booked a 9pm visit we were rushed up to the observation deck, giving us no time to look at the museum, the staff were impatient and short, barking orders to get through security. Once making it to the observation deck we were all being told we had 10 minutes, this was continually shouted until it was down to 5 minutes then we were all asked to make our way out…..overall a very disappointing visit and for $47.91. very poor value for money.",2.0,1.5508
340,Underwhelming,"We booked our slot for 9pm, the last slot, as we wanted a night time visit to see all the lights. This was a mistake. We went to the main entrance but were told we had to go to the entrance round the corner. When we got there there were others standing about and the door was locked. No staff to be seen. One person had a number and phoned and was told we had to go to another entrance further down. Got in and were immediately herded into the security queue and then corralled into the elevators and up to Observation deck. As soon as we exited the elevator the shouting began, ""You have 10 mins, 10 mins"". Few minutes later, "" You have 5 minutes"". Herded back on elevator and back out. $47 for 10 mins. Very underwhelming, especially in comparison to $26 for 9/11 museum and $28 for Natural History Museum, which were both fantastic.",1.0,4.6962
341,Great experience,Our first visit to this magnificent building . What a view . In the late afternoon we were able to see the sites and daylight and witness a beautiful sunset . A very memorable day .,5.0,4.7198
342,Empire State Building,"What a building !!! Absolutely fantastic, from the moment you walk through the revolving doors to the very top the building is so awe inspiring and that’s before you get to the unbelievable views from the top, I wish I’d bought the tickets for a night time visit as well !!!",5.0,4.9022
343,Amazing,The best experience. A must when visiting NYC. Amazing views on s bright sunny day. A film in the elevator made the long ride more interesting. Nice displays and photos on the walls inside on the way up to 86 flott made it fun and interesting being in a line.,5.0,4.9468
344,Younger kids love it!,"My grandchildren loved the building and are still building models of it
a week later. The love talking about it too.",5.0,4.6884
345,Quick visit to Empire State,We had a quick visit to the Empire state building. To be honest it was a bit confusing to find our way into the building. The museum part with the pictures and videos were cool as you were walking up. It wasn’t ideal to have to take two elevators. Also it was really busy so we had to wait and then made seeing some things difficult. Honestly the views at the 86th were nice but I preferred Top of the Rock more.,4.0,4.569
346,"Empire State Building, NY","Being in NY for a limited period, I was challenged to select just a few things to do from the list. After an initial surprise/dismay at the cost of a ticket, The Empire State Building made the cut. I was quite shocked at the cost of a ticket but after a fantastic half day, I was absolutely satisfied at the value for money.

What I hadn't expected was the diverse and engaging multi media displays and presentations that made the trip to the 102 floor all the more enjoyable. Yes there was queuing but the queue moved quickly enough so that I didn't feel as though I had paid to just stand in a line. And if you are going to 'do' The Building, then go the whole hog and make the 102 floor!

The views, admittedly a bright cloudless day, were predictably breathtaking! A wholehearted recommendation for a tourist trip that is so much more than a birdseye view of New York.",5.0,4.9696
347,"Overpriced, not worth the money",At almost $200 this was by far the most expensive activity during our time in NYC and was very poor value for money. Much better views for a fraction of the cost from the Rockefeller Center. We would not recommend paying to go up the Empire Stte Building to anyone.,2.0,3.039
348,WOW,We were at the Empire State Building at 4:45 pm. The waiting times were minimal. There was interesting information downstairs on the first floor. Then we went upstairs. The view is indescribably beautiful. Then we went further up. There we could enjoy a sunset and watch the city darken. New York by Night on the Empire State Building was very impressive.,5.0,4.849
349,Amazing,It was amazing the observation deck and the exhibition also. There was a lot of interactive elements.,5.0,4.1718

351,Brilliant,Not the tallest anymore but the best - iconic! Went at sunset - definitely worth paying a bit more. Book in advance,5.0,4.8368
352,Amazing Views,What an awesome experience!! Had a fall area with leaves and pumpkins for picture opportunities. Interactive screens were cool as well.,5.0,4.786
353,Engagement,I’m not a tourist . Live in SI NY. Had a 6:45pm ticket to the 86th floor and proposed out on the balcony . It was a beautiful night,4.0,4.1988
354,Pre Dawn Empire State Building,Thoroughly enjoyed the predawn access to the 86th floor of the Empire State Building ... I was hoping it was going to be a little longer than it was and that the gift shop would be open after the museum tour .. But the access to the floor without the crowds was an amazing experience and I would most certainly do it again,4.0,4.8622
355,Perfect fall day visit,"We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the 86th and 102nd floors of the Empire State Building. It was a beautiful fall day in NYC so the views could not be beat.
The staff was friendly, helpful and efficient.
While I think this is a one-time experience while visiting NYC, I would recommend it if you haven’t experienced it yet.",5.0,4.9142
356,Breathtaking views!,My daughter and I had an amazing time! It will be a memory that we will always share. We could’ve stayed all day!,5.0,4.5278
357,Empire State Building - 1st Visit,"I visited the Empire State Building in mid-September with my partner and a friend. The line and directions inside the building were well-organized. Multiple staff directing us where to go. The staff was also very helpful and polite.

The exhibits leading up to the elevators to the observation deck were cool, modern, and informative. The main observation deck offered beautiful views of the entire city. We paid the extra price for the 2nd (higher) observation deck and it was well worth it. I highly recommend getting this option if you go visit.

I had originally scheduled my visit solely because the Empire State Building is so iconic and I figured it was something I should do while in NYC. I can say I was pleasantly surprised that the experience exceeded my expectations. Highly recommend adding this to your list of things to do if you visit NYC.",5.0,4.9504
358,Well organised expereience.,"Very enjoyable experience.
The whole setup and staff were very professional, no waiting outside, well organised inside, quite a bit of information on the history of the building if you wanted to look at it, movie history was a nice touch and of course the King Kong photo oppurtunity had to be done.
Good internal viewing area and pretty decent outside area as well.
No presssure to move along, could take your time taking in the sights.
Very lucky with the weather, had fantastic views from the observation areas.",5.0,4.9078
359,Nice visit,"Iconic location and they have a bit of a display to go through first about the building and history. Then there is a large viewing hall then a higher level, all in the normal ticket. Super windy on top! Can't comment on the long range views due to rain but that's not their fault. Vastly superior to the Top of the Rock",5.0,4.8364
360,Too Short,"My visit time was very short, even though I paid 139 dollars, I could not see all the floors and when I reached the 84th floor, I was immediately directed to the 102nd floor.",3.0,3.2054
361,Tasteful and inspiring,"We were lucky to go at a time with relatively few guests, but the exhibition and other arrangements made the visit a great, inspiring and pleasant experience, which it would be even with more visitors.",5.0,4.8986
362,Amazing views,"Worth while spending the money on, stunning views 360 round the whole city, we did the 102 floor as well and it was amazing.",5.0,4.711
363,Excellent,It was an excellent experience. We chose the sunset time. It was bit crowded but nicely managed. At the end you can take the print copy of your pictures as well,5.0,4.6676
364,Great trip,We went 7 years ago and we were pleasantly suprised how it was so updated and we had such a great time. Highly recommend.,5.0,4.7496
365,Me defraudó bastante,"Será de los rascacielos más icónicos (Kin Kong) y antiguos de Nueva York (y de hecho yo lo tuve a tiro de piedra ya que mi hotel estaba a dos manzanas del mismo y fui andando a él la primera noche cuando llegué)... pero...
-larguísimas colas de espera para acceder (a veces se prolongan por toda la calle alrededor del edificio) y para subir (en serio, no merece la pena esperar) (prefiero World Trade one)
Yo gasté dos vales de los tickets de visitas (de día y de noche) pero la verdad, prefiero el Rockefeller center /top of the rock, para ver la ciudad de noche.
Puede que mi opinión negativa tenga que ver en parte porque la visita de día (que me ahorré colas y subí rápido –por cierto, el hall del edificio merece la pena, lugar para fotos, y las escaleras mecánicas creo que tienen mucha historia si no son de las primeras–, me encontré con niebla (te informan de ello el personal por si no te interesa subir, pero no tenía muchos dias)",3.0,1.4434

367,Great fall visit to the Empire State Building,She’s a classic. Great views from 102nd floor. There was much in the immersion experience we could not attend due to time constraints,5.0,4.2498000000000005
368,WOW!,Visited the Empire State Building 26 years ago. Many changes have been made (plus implementing more security measures) since then. Much more has been added.,5.0,3.801
369,Epoustouflant,"L'Empire State Building est tellement mythique. Nous sommes montés sur 4 buildings lors de notre séjour à New York. Celui-ci est époustouflant.

Nous avons pris cette visite avec le city Pass qui a la particularité de donner 2 accès à l'Empire (un de jour et un de nuit) dans la même journée. Nous sommes donc montés au petit matin et le soir du même jour. Et lors de nos 2 visites c'était tout simplement WAOUUUUH. Nous avions choisi le 86éme étage et c'est largement suffisant pour voir toute la magie de New York. La nuit c'est encore plus grandiose. Une visite qui offre de véritables émotions devant la grandeur de cette ville.

Avant de monter au sommet, l'Empire offre un circuit exposition très réussi avec notamment son histoire, sa construction avec la célèbre photo des ouvriers sur la poutre en métal, son aspect technique, sa place dans le cinéma, la pub ou la TV. Ou encore la relation de cette tour avec le célèbre et l'imposant King Kong qui a grimpé sur cette tour (d'ailleurs vous pouvez faire une petite souvenir dans la main de King Kong). Vous pouvez voir aussi des photos des différents évènements et star que l'Empire a accueilli. Cette tour a une dimension mondiale.

Le temps de passer les contrôles de sécurité, d'attendre, de faire le circuit d'exposition, de monter au sommet et profiter de la vue, il faut compter au moins 2h30. La boutique est également sympa, le personnel aimable.

Encore un incontournable de la grosse pomme",5.0,4.1148
370,Terrific sunrise,"We booked the early morning sunrise experience. It was very expensive but definitly worth it. The sunrise was breathtaking and we loved that we got free coffee and had the Empire State Building almost to ourselves. Normally it's really crowded up there. One of our group is terrified of hights and was very afraid in the beginning but at the end of our New York trip even she named that as her highlight of the whole trip.
If you can afford it, book the sunrise experience and pray for good weather.",5.0,4.9328

373,Amazing,"The most iconic place in the world, and all the personnel was extra friendly, the lady at the top was incredibly kind",5.0,4.6536
374,Delivered!,A really magical visit from the 86th floor. It was our first visit to ESB and it delivered on every level. I would suggest a late evening visit as crowds are less and the city lights are magnificent.,5.0,4.1988
375,Excellent outing visiting my daughter in NY,"Awesome experience going up to 102 floor! Totally recommend👌🏻
The tour is very well organized and we maximized our experience.",5.0,4.5546
376,Worth the extra money.,Totally worth the extra price to go at night. The view of the city at night was amazing. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful.,4.0,4.8218
377,Visit to Empire State Building,The views and history of the building were incredible. The staff treated the patrons horribly and the purchase of the express pass was a complete waste of money. None of the staff would explain to us how to use the express pass correctly. We ended up not using it at all.,2.0,1.5298

380,Empire State of mind,V good but could u make it a bit shorter? Surely it can’t be that hard if it was built in 13 months just to take day 30 floors off?,5.0,4.3534
381,Expensive and they closed 102 unexpectedly,We booked three tickets for the Empire State Building. The trip was for the 86th and 102nd floors. But 102 was closed unexpectedly. We didn’t get a refund and we couldn’t go up. It was a waste.,2.0,1.8562
382,One of the best places to visit,"Visiting New York then you have to visit the Empire State Building. One of the most iconic buildings in the city.
The day we went, we bought the ticket for the 86th floor. The first elevator takes you to the 80th floor and gives you a view through the windows at all sides, I thought we had not picked the right ticket but then realised there was another elevator which takes you to the 86th floor and the outside viewing area.
What can I say, absolutely fab. What a view of the city, great photo opportunity. You have to give it a go. When we left there was a large que to get in. You can book tickets on line or pay on the day.
Please visit I'm so glad we did.",5.0,4.9468
383,Great Experience,"Kinda expensive but overall a really good experience, where you can see some historical facts about the building, see how it has influenced pop culture and enjoy magnificent views of NYC",4.0,4.8854
384,Take your time,It was nice to see this attraction. It’s pretty pricey and felt rushed to get to the top. So missed a lot of things. So I recommend just taking your time and don’t feel pressured to get to the top for the view.,4.0,4.777
385,Great staff,"We arrived at 9:45am on a Monday morning and there was already a large line. The staff are organized and informative about the line process. The line moves pretty fast. I highly recommend getting up to the 102nd floor as the views are fantastic.

I’d like to mention Renita E who was extremely fun and delightful. She had a great attitude. She took pictures of us with our phone. You made your Vancouver, Canadian couples visit memorable. Thanks!",5.0,4.9597999999999995
386,NYC must do,"The ESB is a must do for any NYC neophyte and they have vastly improved the visit since we were here about twenty years ago. The exhibit is well done and kids will enjoy them. Go ahead and splurge on the access to floor 102 with your regular ticket, it's a great view from even higher up and you're protected from the elements at the tippy top. Fantastic colors at sunset!",5.0,4.9284
387,Empire State Building on a cloudy day,"Entry not a problem, no queues, great views despite clouds and showers. The wind outside on floor 82 enhanced the visit.",4.0,4.609
388,Can’t Visit NYC Without Checking Out Empire State,"We did a nighttime visit so there were no crowds. The views are spectacular and there are a lot of historical exhibits on your journey to the top. Very interesting and informative.
We hit both the 86th and 102nd floors. Highly recommend the experience.
Also, feel free to draw on the knowledge of the guides working there. They know their stuff. You will leaving know alot more about the City than you did when starting the tour.",5.0,4.6274

391,Day trip,"Arrived a half hour before our scheduled ticket time. The lines were very organized. The people working the lines were very strict, but very fair and entertaining. The lines moved rather quickly. It was an organized trip. Highly recommended buying your tickets beforehand. I would suggest going early, possibly the first timeslot as it gets crowded and the wait times become longer as more people linger bring a sweatshirt if possible because it gets cold up there and breezy.",5.0,4.7654
392,Great building.,I have been to the top before. But this time I just looked as walking around. It’s such a cool building and has been in so many movies. A great part of NYC.,5.0,4.7718
393,Iconic building,"If you have never been before, it’s worth a visit. Beautiful building and good views but there are many buildings offering views and in my opinion the more modern buildings such as the Edge offer a better all round experience.",3.0,4.6541999999999994

397,Empire Stats Building Night visit,My 19 yr old son & I visited from Australia he loved it. A highlight of our NYC trip 💚 After not being able to get into the Summit any disappointment didn’t linger once at the 82ns & 86th levels. A visit to #1 WTC the next day in the afternoon complimented this night time memory.💚🦘🥃,5.0,4.4006

400,Spectacular View,"We visited the 86th floor, which is an open air deck. Much better than the higher closed air, and 86 is plenty high enough. Beautiful views all throughout the circular deck. You can see the Statue of Liberty, Staten Island, New Jersey, the Hudson River, the east river, Brooklyn Bridge, Staten Island bridge. The Empire State building is a must – see if you are touring and visiting New York City",5.0,4.645

402,Robert & Elizabeth-Empire State Building,"The Empire State Building was amazing. The staff was super friendly too. We were delayed getting in town, and it was planned for the first day. After dinner, we went to the Empire State building at 11:00 pm! No lines as we walked in on the red carpet! We stepped out on the 86th floor and the WOW factor was amazing! We loved this view so much. Highly recommend the late night!",5.0,4.9564

404,Great View... not so great employees,"The view and history of the Empire State Building is amazing! Would 100% recommend it to anyone. The only issue was some of the employees were rude and couldn't care less about the visitors. I had this one lady at the security check point look me up and down with a judgey look on her face asking me where I was from and when I told her she said ""that makes sense"". The people at the top were nice, but I did not care for the rest of the employees.",3.0,2.7956
405,Still amazing,"From the well managed queue on entrance, we’d prebooked the first slot and arrived early otherwise there wouldn’t have been a queue, to the exit through the gift shop this was an amazing attraction.
We last visited six years ago and there has definitely been a revamp,from the entrance you now pass through the history of the Empire State Building with plenty of interesting facts,up the 80 floors in an elevator with a ceiling that creates the impression it’s open as you soar up. On arrival there’s wall to wall pictures of a host of famous visitors and then you get to the view, I can’t imagine how many times you’d see it before you got weary of it.
From start to finish it could take anything from 30minutes to several hours to absorb the whole experience and there was no pressure to rush your way through.",5.0,4.8574
406,"Great view, outstanding customer service","Clean environment and an appropriate amount of people. Good staff to visitor ratio.

409,Renita E made the difference for our experience,"We arrived a little before 10am on a Tuesday and there was already a large line. With the Express Pass, we were first in line to enter the building.

I wanted to zone out, but Gerard made the tour incredibly thought-provoking. His passion for the history of the Empire State Building came through engaging each person on our tour. We enjoyed it so much that I would go back to hang out with Gerard. He is one of those people that makes NYC a special place.",5.0,4.9096

413,Enjoyed the city lights after dark,We wanted to go at night to see the city lights and it was amazing. There were some fun exhibits along the way. The KingKong was fun and the elevator shaft elusion was also. But the highlight was seeing the city light all around the city.,4.0,4.6632

Def pick this ticket up to get to the top, I think it's well worth the money.",5.0,4.7596
417,Awesome views,"We went later in the evening, 10 pm. We walked straight up to the 86th and 102nd floors. Not very busy. Melvin F was awesome. He chat with us and offered to take our photo. So shout out Melvin- told you I would leave you a review :)",5.0,4.6632

We had to show our tickets and proof of COVID vaccination before we could even enter the building. Security was quick (I should mention we went around 9am). My 9 and 11 year old boys enjoyed everything. Gift shop was a tight fit though.,5.0,4.9116

426,Amazing building let down by it's staff,"We visited at the beginning of September, and were told by the staff you have to book on line which is clearly not so as you can buy tickets inside. The staff are abrupt and rude, they seem to have forgotten their role involves helping customers. The costumes they wear are ill fitting, dirty and disheveled. Surely it is not beyond the capability of a supervisor to teach them how to use an iron, I very much doubt if they even know what shoe polish is, let alone how to use it. The building itself is lovely and the view exquisite, it may not be the tallest but it does have the history.",3.0,2.5524
427,Great views,"We opted to do this at night (after the sunset slots which they charge extra for). Seems a lot of people decided to do the same as us as it was very busy at this time. The views are great and although it might not be the highest anymore it’s still fantastic to visit such an iconic building.

The experience was let down though by security procedures. The whole process of getting in seemed a bit of a mess. No one actually checks you have a valid ticket until after you are in the building and been security checked. Surely this should be checked first? Then at the barriers where you show your ticket it is not clear what you show if you have a pass (rather than having purchased a ticket directly from the Empire State Building).

The exhibits are very well done and keep you entertained as you make your way to the top. And the view from the top is iconic New York City. If you’re in NYC, you simply have to visit the Empire State Building!",5.0,4.8233999999999995
430,Empire State,Myself and my son had a brilliant visit to the Empire State well worth paying to all the way up. It was the highlight of our visit to NeeYork. Really classy building .,5.0,4.816
431,Empire,Enjoyed my Empire State Building visit! Very nice exhibit. Only thing I would recommend is more signage on the entrance. It was kinda hard to find the correct entrance.,4.0,4.6866
432,Worth every penny!,The 86th and 102nd floor tour around 7pm was just stunning. Worth noting the attendants working there were helpful and great and really added to the experience.,5.0,4.772
433,Great NYC Attraction,"My friend had never been to the ESB so it was time for a trip. We went on a Saturday in September 2022 and it was magical. The signage could have been better because if you buy the tickets to the 86th and 102nd floors, you have to take three different elevators and you have to wind around to those elevators in a strange fashion. 80th first, walk around, 86th second, walk around, and finally 102nd third, and walk around. When you are done, you will be able to go to the gift shop on the lower level.
Other than that, it was a great experience with great views. Totally get the picture package made from the picture you take when you first enter through the lobby. Allow some time to take in these awesome views of the city.",5.0,4.9304

441,"Overbooked, crowded and unenjoyable!!",I went with my friend around the sunset hour and there was a huge line downstairs!! Upstairs were too many people you couldn’t even have a look at the view let alone take a picture. For the price we paid it was a very disappointing experience! I know it’s tourist season but it still was too crowded and very unenjoyable!!! What’s the point of timed tickets??,1.0,3.7354000000000003

443,Worth the money,"My first time in NYC, I was a little reluctant to believe the hype - seeing a city from high up is nice and all, but it wouldn't have been the first time a ""must-see"" location ended up being a little underwhelming. I cannot overstate how much this wasn't the case!
My friend and I booked a sunset time slot. After going through the corridors highlighting major events in the life of this building, we finally got to the elevators and went up to the first viewing point. In the daylight the city was beautiful - the whole of Manhattan, the river, the city beyond provided such a dramatic backdrop, it was stunning! By the time we went up the second elevator to the outside balcony, dusk has finally started settling in. Little by little the city lights started to come on - the sun was setting - and suddenly the view has transformed completely. Against the already lovely colours of the sky the city lights painted an even more beautiful picture - I have no idea how long we stayed there just admiring the view. Definitely one of the highlights of our trip!",5.0,4.9726

453,Amazing Empire state building experience,"The Empire State building was AMAZING! I highly recommend visiting this landmark. My 11 and 12 year old kids absolutely loved it. They have a little museum showcase on the 80th floor i believe before going to the 86th floor for the outside experience. Its very well layed out and entertaining. The views are amazing! I recommend you purchase the additional 102nd floor view. Don't be cheap, its a ounce in a lifetime experience. Also, i recommend you visit one of the other observation decks, so that you can see the empire state building from that point of view. Just a heads up- DON'T reserve the sunset view on the empire building, reserve it on one of the other buildings, like the Edge observation deck. WHY, because you will be able to see the Empire state building LIGHT UP from the other building! Enjoy your trip!",5.0,4.973
454,Empire State Building is just Awesome and book the VIP Tour,"We booked the VIP Guided Tour (Premium Experience) and our tour guide was Renita E.! At first, nobody knew that we were coming but after Renita showed up, it ended up being the absolute best sightseeing tour ever! Renita is very passionate about her job, she knows so much and makes you feel special! It was a true VIP Tour with beautiful views, a history lesson and also opportunities you would never get! The Empire State Building is truly a historic building which YOU HAVE TO SEE! Book the VIP tour and ask for Renita!",5.0,4.9882
455,Don't Miss Visiting the Empire State Building,We only had a little time to visit The Empire State Building so we prioritized getting to the 86th floor observation deck. I wish we had more time to explore the museum and the gift shop. There wasn't a huge crowd so that was nice as we were able to get on the elevator quickly and make our way to the deck. I am glad we made the decision to go up. Our other option was shopping at Macy's! The staff are excellent and very helpful. They are also very friendly and welcoming. Don't miss this when in NYC!,5.0,4.9510000000000005

457,NYC Skyline Review,Everything was great! The observation deck was nice. Rain was forecasted but never showed during our sunset visit. I do recommend paying the extra if you can in order to bypass as many lines as possible.,4.0,4.5802
458,A great view with equally impressive exhibits!,"I was surprised at how much effort was put into the museum exhibits which you pass through on the second floor before taking the elevator up to the top. I was not expecting the ticket, which I initially thought was overpriced, to include something like this! It's actually a very interactive experience that puts you back in time when the Empire State Building once loomed large over the city. An impressive technological feat that can get lost if you just go up for the view, so definitely give yourself time to explore the exhibits first!",5.0,4.6944
459,Great experience,A great tour. There was enough to read without being overwhelming and the CGI stuff was brilliant. We went to the very top and had it to ourselves at one point.,5.0,4.7496

461,Pleasant experience with Empire State Building,The visit was very exciting. We did miss our time slot but they allowed us without any questions. Thanks to them.,5.0,2.425
462,Disappointing,Unfortunately was not a great experience. We bought a “reservation” for a certain time but the viewing area was packed with people literally standing crammed together hoping for a glimpse of the view. It’s unbelievable that we would pay so much money to wait in extremely long lines and be packed in like sardines. They clearly over sell tickets and the “reservation” is pointless. Very disappointing experience for the amount of money we paid (over $100 for two people),2.0,4.2408
463,Sunrise,It was a very clear day. The weather was perfect. This view is truly breathtaking. Please make plans to do it at least once.,5.0,4.8598
464,Everything was great but…,"Firstly, the on-site team at ESBNYC was great. Most of them were polite and courteous to the entire crowd.

I have the following feedback for management:
1. Please put up signs indicating where people need to queue to enter the building. Everyone hears they have to start queueing next to Starbucks but ends up trying to get in from the revolving doors next to the Starbucks Reserve. Proper marshaling can help mitigate crowd frustration. Even something as simple as a standee or a poster indicating where to queue can change things.

2. The booking for time-slots is somewhat misleading. It tells you you’re booking a 15 minute slot but you reach ESB and then it turns out that is just your entry time?? I paid $10 above ticket price for the sunset slots. However, because of this misinformation, I did not get to stop by any of the exhibits inside the building and had to rush to the top.

3. ESBNYC needs to find a way to limit the time people spend on top of the tower because it is NOT fair to the ones who pay extra money to be there for sunsets. I spoke to people who were on the 80th and 86th floor since over 60 minutes. I don’t know how this can be done effectively, but I’m pretty sure it is possible.",3.0,4.82
465,Great Experience as Always,I have done this a few times before and this one was great too. There is a self guided tour that talks about the history of the building which is cool too. Things have been upgraded since my last visit about 4 years ago.,5.0,4.5012

475,Getting better with time,"Our family of six (kids ages 10-16) had a great trip. We bought tickets in advance, and we found the lines to be very manageable. The displays on the way to the upper decks were interactive and informative - much better than when we have visited in years past. The computer animation is cool, and it’s smart the way they have included displays on the ceilings of the elevators also. The views were as stunning as ever. Would highly recommend.",5.0,4.8936

481,Visit review,"The process of getting to the upper floor felt like moving a herd/cattle. A mood-destroying process that no one asked for neither is pleased to be part of by the time we reach the 86th floor. The 102nd floor was the compensation. Overall, an over-priced, over-crowded experience: becoming a tourist trap to be avoided if not improved and smoothed.",2.0,1.3894
482,Great View...Shame About The Staff,"The Empire State Building is a must visit, iconic experience...the view is amazing That said, the security staff are rude and talk to you as if you are stupid and are just extremely unpleasant. That combined with the scammers picking on visitors in the queue outside (which the staff inside know all about, but choose to ignore) ruined the overall experience.
If the scamming issue outside was dealt with, and the security staff inside learnt some manners, then this would without doubt be a 5 star rating. Such a shame.",3.0,1.5934
483,NYC Must See!,"Loved going up the Empire State Building! While I had been in it before for work, I’ve never made my way to the top. When visiting with my nephew for the first time, this experience was at the top of his list. He loved it! Great views of Manhattan and Central Park. We were able to spot Yankee Stadium which was fun for him.

The elevator rides were awesome. Loved the video of them building as you go up!

I’d recommend maps or iPads that tell you what you’re looking at. Later on our trip we did One World Observatory and loved the interactive iPad map.

Since we had so much to fit on this trip I did buy the express tickets for 86&102 so we wouldn’t have to wait in line. Somehow there wasn’t a line anyway when we went so it was sort of a waste but I appreciated the VIP treatment nonetheless.",5.0,4.9646
484,Great exhibits,The exhibits at the Empire State Building are extremely well done. It is visually stunning. It is also very informative. Each part of the exhibit connects you to the story and the magnitude of the importance of the building.,5.0,4.5148

I live in Brooklyn and my two young kids have been curious to ""go to the top"" so we finally did it and the entire experience exceeded expectation. Though it's not cheap, the lead-in to the viewing decks is lots of fun and there are lots of fun photo ops. A weekday afternoon was also great for avoiding crowds. Highly recommend for tourists and locals to take in the greatest building in the greatest city in the world!",5.0,4.9643999999999995
486,Empire State Building / New York City - King Kong loved it and so will you!,"The Empire State Building is a 102-story Art Deco skyscraper in Midtown Manhattan, New York City.
The building was designed by Shreve, Lamb & Harmon and built from 1930 to 1931. Its name is derived from ""Empire State"", the nickname of the state of New York.
The Empire State Building and its ground-floor interior were designated city landmarks by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1980, and were added to the National Register of Historic Places as a National Historic Landmark in 1986.
The Art Deco architecture, height, and observation decks have made it a popular attraction & icon. Approx. four million tourists from around the world annually visit the building's 86th- and 102nd-floor observatories (Spire).
The building has been featured in more than 250 television series and films since the film King Kong was released in the year 1933.
Staff is super friendly and helpful.
I personally would only recommend the fast lane tickets during super peak times in the summer, otherwise the ""regular"" tickets work just fine.
Also the tickets for the 102 floor visit appear a bit super pricy and the views from the regular 86 floor are equally phenomenal and significantly less expensive than for the 102 floor. The decision is yours as always.",5.0,4.9528
487,Book an earlier slot for sunset,We hadn’t realized that there was a display explaining the history of the Empire State Building on the way to the elevator.

Once at the top you can go straight out on the deck and wander all the way round for great views of the city.

Staff all very friendly, with one exception. The security guy in return for the night visit betrayed me for arriving 4 mins early… I’d checked on exit when the ticket was valid and was told after sun down - we arrived an hour after sunset and it was totally dark, so we were not going to get the sunset experience. Recommend double checking the time you have return validity. The ESB could make this more clear",5.0,4.6868

522,Be a Gorilla and go to the top the views will not disappoint,"This was our second trip to the big Apple. We had not been to the Empire State Building before so this was our first time. I thought the views from One Freedom tower were awesome, I was mistaken the views of NYC. From the 84th floor were amazing then the outdoor viewing area was incredible, buts that’s not all there is another viewing area at the top of the building. It is a must see attraction. If your a romantic their is a sunset viewing time but they fill up quick.",5.0,4.6844
523,Very impressive,A very well organised experience. The museum was interesting and informative. Obviously the highlight was the viewing platform on the 86th floor.

525,Chambers family,We really enjoyed our visit to the Empire State Building. And we really appreciate the outstanding family photo that a lady there took of us. It is so nice to have a great family photo that captures the view and experience.,5.0,4.9232
526,Wonderful Experience - Couldn't be happier,"The ticket process was easy, the signage clear. The staff was friendly and helpful. It's a bit of a fun museum maze at first but once you reach the elevator banks it becomes a delightful ride up with excellent distractions, photo opportunities and cheerful assistants pointing the way to the more favorable parts of the the tour before going out on the observation deck. Which is well managed, people are generally pleasant and the views spectacular. We did not go all the way up to the top as we did not have the time that day but overheard it was pretty amazing as well.

Highly recommend this if your in NYC and have the opportunity.",5.0,4.9916

529,Never Goes Out of Style,"There are bigger buildings. There are tours with more things to do. But this is just a must see.

From up top my family of four could still hear and see and the City. This high up you’re above the City. But New York is so big you still feel like a part of the City. And the actual history of The Empire State Building is second to none.

I teach high school US History, and coming here is a history lesson in disguise. This building is US history, so going up The Empire State Building learning disguised as a fun unforgettable experience.",5.0,4.3911999999999995

532,Great views but disorganised,"We went up the ESB just before sunset to see the city in light & dark & would definitely recommend this time of day. The views were magnificent & the building is gorgeous.

We paid extra to skip the line, but this was very disorganised & a couple of times the staff put us in the regular line. Still probably just about worth it though.",5.0,4.672

537,Fun experience,"We took our three grandchildren and found it a fun activity. The variety of things - videos in the elevators, second floor exhibit, then two different observatories, plus photo op spots, made it enjoyable.

However, once to the observation deck, it was the same as many other top of the building trips. It you must have a skip line tour, this is good but just pick one.
Also, the entrance was very difficult to find, we went to three different places.

We got tickets through city pass, where we got 5 excursions for one set price.",4.0,3.9394

546,One of the highlights of our honeymoon!,"Great experience during our honeymoon! Used Go City passes but paid extra to upgrade to sunset tickets. Security process was smooth, staff were friendly, information in the museum was interesting and the views from 86th floor were amazing! We also enjoyed the tipsy ice cream tubs for adults which helped settle my husband’s nerves a little before braving the outdoor observatory. There were quite a lot of other people around but if you’re patient, you can get a good spot to admire the views and take photos. Also there were some nice things to purchase in the gift shop at the end of the visit. Second time we have done the Empire State Building and we would return for a third time!",5.0,4.9824

554,Very good but costly,"Museum was interactive and fun. Might have liked it to have more information and depth. Highlight definitely the 102nd floor for the views. A must visit for anyone in New York, it’s historic and beautifully designed inside and out. Maybe 102 floor should be first followed by 86th floor for the wow factor! Felt very expensive for a family of 4 and that the owners are heavily capitalising/taking advantage on its unique place in history so much that even though many would grimace at the price they would not be able to ignore. That said it was very much enjoyed!",4.0,4.931

567,"ESB was fun, I don’t recommend trip advisor","I enjoyed the Empire State Building, the layout was nice. The line was long but they were able to let at least 50 people in at a time. There’s so much to explore it didn’t feel overcrowded until you got to the observation deck. Overall I recommend this for a visit. I went on a Monday evening. I did however have a difficult time using the trip advisor app. Downloading the app was a challenge, it wouldn’t recognize any of my confirmation numbers, I had to take 30 minutes to find my ticket. The ticket I received in my email to download to Apple wallet did not work at all. It was very frustrating. I was ever able to use the app, the tickets need to be more easily accessible.",4.0,3.8236

The night has a special feel, with all the lights of NYC",5.0,4.8486
570,' The Empire state building ' my perfect 4th of July !,"Hello, my ' The Empire state building observatory ' advance reservation was booked with my ( CityPASS ). When I arrived there was quite the queue but if you have an advance reservation a staff member scans your print off or phone and you are straight in. So, to save some time book in advance. I found ' The Empire state building tour ' well run. After being scanned in and a breif security check I was left to explore the exhibits at my leisure. Before the elevator up there are very impressive exhibits about the origins, construction and history etc of the building. Large images decorate the walls and there are also models. Original exhibits are on display along with video footage. I had selfies with life size models of construction workers and a selfie in ' King Kong's ' paw with him looking in at you is a must !. The highlight of course is being up on the observation deck. I found it one of those ' Bucket list ' moments. Again, there was a lot of visitors but no pressure from staff. Magic",5.0,4.9218

572,Empire State Building Observation Deck,For our first visit to New York with three children we were able to choose only one of the observation decks to visit. Over the years we have visited many but the last visit to the Empire State Building was twenty years ago. Safe to be said it is much improved on that long queue in the basement! Timed slot tickets (we were actually 30minutes early) meant no queue to speak of. The museum part is informative and puts everything in context while the focused exhibits on the iconic building in film and television is a joy to watch. Then comes the observation deck itself. Being in Mid-town the views are great from all sides. Take your time and make sure you are able to take photos.,5.0,4.9538
573,Best view!,"Buy the NY to be able to enter and you must make a reservation, they will let you in 1 hour before your reservation time. Super friendly staff, the building is very nice, as you continue advancing you can see the history of the building. I am a person who does not like heights. But the view is great.",5.0,4.7864

578,Customer Service Training Required,"So we had our booking for the evening. Staff were friendly and the views were amazing, but then my family's experience dramatically dived!
We took an official group photo by the staff which you purchase at the end of the visit. However, when we got to pay we found that not all family members were not on the photo. There couldn't have been an issue of space as there was so much space left on on side, yet the photo was taken cutting 2 members out! We queried this and even asked if we could have another picture taken, as this was suggested by another member of staff. The staff member (female, petite, wearing glasses), refused and was rude telling us to 'pay or don't buy, that she needs to go home!' The actual gentleman who initially suggested maybe taking another photo, then changed his tune as the 2 were talking openly about my family and I, as it we weren't there, saying that, that was ""a read"", and the photo wasn't taken properly, and she won't agree to take it again so their not asking.
I was so disgusted! It felt like my family and I were an inconvenience, rather than paying for an experience - which I would've preferred not to.
Customer Service training is definitely required, for the staff dealing with the photos at least!",3.0,1.1458

591,A must see at night,"I had a recommendation to visit The Empire State Building late at night and it the best tip - what a bonus. Well worth it.
The directions and lines that lead you to the top take time. This is a journey and educational experience. It’s not simply an elevator and boom you’re there.
This is an educational experience, where you learn about the whole construction of the Empire State Building. Be prepared for some queues but they move quickly.
Right now a big shout out to all staff at TESB.. your enthusiasm and passion for your work is outstanding. Most appreciated to have your sense of humour and enjoyment of your job making the experience even better.
Finally made it to the top and was 3 people deep-and a tiny bit of a nighttime, we were all looking for that special photo. Mine was #chryslerbuilding but so many more beautiful architectural pieces to hone in on.
It was July and still very warm on the 82nd floor. Five deep and hard to get a good photo. Invite people were mostly respectful and allowed others in.
The whole experience took around an hour. You exit via the “store”. And as delightful the items are on display , I passed on this one.
Uber back to the hotel was cheap and easy to catch.
Note: please wear a mask on the elevators and other places where you can’t social distance.
Exit is fast and easy via stairs or elevator. And as always, exit via the gift shop.
A huge shout out to the team who put this experience together. Not corny. Not expensive. And the staff on the ground were brilliant.

592,Top Tip if you have kids who struggle to queue!,"Went in the morning yesterday (10th Aug) to check out the best thing to do to visit by speaking to staff actually at the ESB. The main reason for doing this is 1. I have an autistic teenager and they don’t do well in crowds or long queues and 2. the weather, which was cloudy and grey. Not what you want for your only possible visit to the top of ESB. The lines at 9am were long. It doesn’t open until 10am. The outside ESB staff are stereotypical New Yorkers who don’t want to answer your questions and just go on broadcast to tell you what they want to say. So I had a female ESB staff member shouting information I hadn’t asked for in my face at significant volume in front of a LONG line of members of the public. All she wanted to do was get me in the queue to go inside. She wasn’t banking on me, not easily embarrassed or bullied lol! I stood my ground and resisted, I’m so glad I did. So here is what I did. I waited to see what the weather would do. At 9am grey and cloudy by 3pm bright and sunny with the occasional cloud.. So at 3pm I bought 4 x Standard Admission tickets ONLINE for 5pm that very same day (eradicating one possible queue). Our party of 4 arrived at the ESB at 4.55pm, NO queue. We walked up the next floor, a few people but still NO queue. We spent a few minutes in two exhibits you are made to go through enroute to get to the elevators, hardly any people and NO queue. We were on the 86th Floor ESB observation deck in just over 6 minutes from ground up! IF I had listened to the ESB staff member outside I would have queued for my ticket (1hr) and at that time in the morning waited another 2 hrs to get up to the top for a cloudy view. IF I had paid in excess of $400 for the VIP ticket for no queues I’d have been furious given NO queues! And you can stay up there as LONG AS YOU LIKE. So the best thing if you can is buy a ticket mid-week for 6.30pm (no sunset charge), stay an 1.5hr and you’ll see the sunset for the Standard Admission price! I have been up the top of the World Trade Towers (when they were there🥲), The Rockerfeller Centre and the ESB many times. It’s 23 years since my last journey to the top of the ESB and it’s STILL the best IMHO. Just ignore the staff outside and try a mid-week between 4-6pm slot if you can. Even if you do have to queue, it’ll still be worth it.",5.0,4.906

First, it was pretty crowded except the 102nd floor on a Monday at 1:15 pm. But what made our trip and left us with a glow and love for the people of New York were the employees at Empire State Building. They saw we were in need, they protected us from the crowds and helped us with kindness and humor. These employees likely have no idea how much their acts of kindness and professionalism made our entire trip, but they did. The 102nd floor is totally worth it, as well.

We were there on a hot, summer afternoon and appreciated the breeze up on the 86th floor. Great views, as expected, and we spent a pleasant time of roughly 30-40 minutes outside.

603,"Spur of the moment visit, done it before but still a must do every time we visit","We’ve done it before and we did it again, done the Rock, The Edge at Hudson’s Yard and the 102nd floor here on New Years at night, however our daughter who was around 9 last one we came said she could remember what it was like, great ploy!! So around 2.30pm and near 5th Av off we set to find ESB access for tickets is actually around the corner near the Starbucks not in the main entrance, but do go in there for the obligatory pictures of the Art Deco lobby, once we had our tickets and being less busy at that time we were straight to bag checks and up the elevator to the first indoor observatory floor which is indoor then into the next elevator to the top outside observation floor, there is another elevator to the 102nd floor observation space, quite small in comparison and as I’d done this before and it costs on top of your admission ticket I did t do that this time, anyway I’d hung off the Climb at the Edge at the same night as this the day before so had a good head for how high this building is, still an iconic location that never ceases to make you feel this is a special place scenes from so many movies and actors in the past and no doubt the future more so than buildings far taller but non so iconic as the Empire State Building, and I’d probably do it again when I return 😂😂",4.0,4.8218

614,"If can splurge, spend the extra on Express and do the 1st time offered on a weekday morning!","Recently visited this iconic site on a Tuesday morning (family of 5) when it first opened - spent a lot on express but SO worth it to make most of time in NY, no lines!! This was my kids fav experience in our almost weeklong NY trip besides Statue of Liberty. Everything is fabulous from exhibits on 2nd floor to the 80th, 86th, and 102nd. I recommend doing them ALL - but again go when it first opens, do express, and buy tickets in advance!!! We were only ones on 102 floor besides another family of 3, so perfect/private pics! This is way more than a building, the exhibits on 2nd floor are mind blowing!!!",5.0,4.934
615,Iconic,"It is what it is! There is present a lot of effort to package and make interesting and exciting the attraction. A lot of people were having fun with it. Rather than a straight shot to the top for the iconic views, the visitor is taken through various exhibits of the building's construction, history and starring role in movies. To me it felt a bit like an effort to justify the admission price. And it is not inexpensive. The views of the city and its surrounds from the inside and outside decks are quite impressive. If the weather is sketchy, be sure to check the live camera, to make sure the views aren't obscured by clouds or rain. All in all worthwhile if in your budget.",4.0,4.9566
616,Amazing 👏🏾,My daughter and I have a great time at the ESB!! The check in with online tickets was easy and the airport like security was a breeze. I loved their uniforms because it made it seem like we went back in time. Everyone was helpful and personable. The exhibits were very interactive and top notch. Unfortunately it was overcast the day we visited but the view from the 86th floor was still insane!! So so good! It was one of my 7 year old's favorite stops in NYC! It caters to all ages and they also do a 20% military discount in the gift shop!! 🥰,5.0,4.9292

624,Great Experience,"Went at 10:00pm, was not crowded, didn’t wait in any lines. The lights were beautiful. It was definitely worth going later at night because going during sunset is busy and getting an express pass costs double a regular ticket.

Though the price seemed a bit steep just to go to the top of a building, we were not disappointed! There are other interactive elements inside that keep you occupied on your way up. The facility is clean and well maintained. The staff was mostly pleasant and helpful and they were positioned in multiple places.

648,Go early for no lines,We went on July 30 (Friday) with 10 am tickets to the 86th floor only. We happened to get there a bit early (9:35am) and we were allowed to go on in to the 2nd floor line for security. We waited a short amount there and then moved along with small crowds. At no time did we feel like we couldn’t pause to take a photo or see a view on the 80th and 86th floors. It was the best time to go! Definitely glad we didn’t buy the express line for that time in the morning. After that we never waited more than 3 minutes for the elevators. But the lines were longer when we left around 11:30. It was so worth the experience to see the city and visit the historic building. At the end you come out in the original elevator hallway that I remember as a teen!!! The stand binoculars are also working again and so amazing. The teen boys (12 and 18) enjoyed the exhibits and the views.,5.0,4.9594000000000005

650,Great Experience,"I went to the ESB for the sunrise option and it was great. The view was amazing and there wasn't a crowd which is a wonderful plus. After the sunrise, then you have the opportunity to explore the gallery. Again, without the crowd so you can really take it all in. It was great. The only thing I was missing was the Starbucks coffee that was associated with the ticket. When I asked about it they said they discontinued that option but for the day it would be there at 630am. It never showed up. A little misleading and disappointing.",4.0,3.5624000000000002

The views are amazing, the history is phenomenal and even the long elevator ride is designed to distract you from the ear popping rise with a quick video. I loved it! I can't believe I hadn't gone earlier. The tickets are expensive, but the lines are long even with the $77 price tag. We went to the 86th and 102nd floors and paid extra for the express lane. I can't rave about spending the extra 25 bucks enough. There are lines to get into the elevator to go to the 80th floor (inside only) and then lines to go to the 86th floor observation deck and the 102nd floor (inside only). With the express lane, you bypass all the lines. The general rule is 1-2 hours for the entire exhibit, but with the lines, it can be over 4 hours. We were able to see everything in just over an hour.

Of course, the Empire State Building is one of the most fascinating locations in the Manhattan sky I would rate 5/5. Already knowing the observatory our visit early in the morning ought to be an increasement of the standard exploration during the day. Unfortunately, they cannot influence the weather... it was cloudy and so we didn't experience a spectacular sun rise. I couldn’t blame anyone for that. But, against the description on the web side, where the event is scheduled from 5 to 8 am, we have been asked to leave the observatory at 6 am already. Afterwards we have been invited for one simple coffee at Starbucks… Therefore, I have to say, the event wasn’t worth the ticket price.
One positive addition: of course, the gift shop wasn’t open early in the morning. But when we came along the Empire State Building a few days later, we were given access to the shop by showing our sunrise tickets.",3.0,4.8402

The best time to go it's in the early morning if you don't want to find too many people, otherwise you could go around evening to enjoy the sunset view!We loved that!!!",5.0,4.9366
700,Love Empire State Building,Great visit with family. Last time I was visited was 2016 and so many changes in the visit experience - all great ! Some family members visiting for the first time and were blown away with the visit.Staff were super helpful and made it it all easy.,5.0,4.9178
701,Amazing experience,Just an amazing and jaw dropping experience. This was a family holiday and out first time in NYC for us all. We went at 9pm and the experience and views were amazing. Collectively the best part of our NYC trip .,5.0,4.8764
702,Very enjoyable,Loved the history behind the empire state and the views were amazing the staff were very organised and we were at the observatory very quick,5.0,4.6541999999999994
703,Great expensive view of NYC,"We had just visited attracktions in Seatlte, various parts of Spain, Paris, and NYC in the past month and the Empire State Building was by far the most expensive with no extras, no freebies, nothing but the view.",3.0,2.712
704,VIP probably saved an hour or two in queues,"We have been to the ES a couple of times before but this was my 15 year old son's first time. The Empire State is a must see in New York. A friend told us about the VIP tickets and although they are eye-wateringly expensive, we could walk to the Elevator person who got us straight on the next lift, and this happened on entry and on the three floors we could visit with these tickets. If time is a premium, then this ticket is the way to go.",5.0,4.8434
705,Amazing experience,"Having previously visited the Empire State Building a few years ago, this was the first time we had visited with our children (aged 14 and 8) and it did not disappoint.

We booked Express tickets which I would highly recommend as we skipped the majority of the queues whilst entering and making our way to the 80th, 86th the 102nd floors.

Access was extremely well organised with plenty of staff stationed at all elevator doors ensuring everyone stayed on the right path to where they needed to be.

This was the first time I had visited the 102nd floor and was well worth the additional cost. The views over the city are spectacular.

I would highly recommend visiting the Empire State Building whilst in NYC",5.0,4.8957999999999995
706,A must for first-time visitors,"Extremely well organised visit. Staff guide you throughout. No time limit, so enjoy the views from different floors at your own pace. We paid extra to go to the very top, where there is a rather small space with floor-to-ceiling windows. Views are pretty much the same, though. I actually preferred the platform further down because you are exposed to the elements and hear the noise of Manhattan.",5.0,4.704
707,Unique experience,"The Empire State Building remains the go-to skyscraper for the best air view of Manhattan and the greater NY area. The view is breathtaking, and the exhibition is very well thought of, funny and entertaining.",5.0,4.9018
708,Very exited attraction. Very recommended,Business meetings in NYC included Empire State top view. Before boarding the elevator there was a spectacular display that included quite a few exhibits,5.0,3.4046
709,Excellent,We enjoyed the view and the stops at the 86 and 102 floors. What a great time and was enjoyed by 3 generations.,5.0,4.6352
710,Fun and uncrowded,"We thought it will be full of people but it was not. If you are willing to spend that money, it is a good experience. OK overall.",5.0,4.6588
711,Sunset on the Empire State,"Here's a little tip for people going to the observatory for sunset. Unless you are a giant or are prepared to physically fight people to get a good picture or video of the sunset, don't waste your time going to the 86th floor which takes you outside. Instead, stay on the 80th floor which is inside. It will mean you are looking through a window but hardly anybody else will be there (compared to the hordes on the 86th floor jostling for space). And the view is just as good albeit through a window. But think about this .... on the 86th floor you have to hold your camera through the wrought iron ""cage"" which stops nutters throwing themselves (or other people) over the edge. On the 80th floor, what I did was place my phone against the window (on the sill) and recorded a hyperlapse video over 30 odd minutes. It makes for a stunning compressed ½ minute video. It would be impossible to do that on the 86th floor.",4.0,4.3748000000000005
712,Very good,We enjoyed this trip a lot. It was a mind blowing experience. We wish to be here again. The view which was gifted to us was really grateful,4.0,4.7032

722,"The most amazing views, also great history well presented.","I was lucky to see the sunset from the Empire State Building. I booked a slightly earlier ticket which was cheaper (the last before the sunset times) and I spent time downstairs learning about the history of the building, it was really interesting. The exhibition is made very very well for all ages. The famous movies part is great and the King Kong bit is funny. The queues were never big. The sunset time at the top was very busy, so make sure you get a spot early. I’d recommend capturing it with the time lapse function on your phone. Overall, greatly recommended!",5.0,4.942

The staff was all exceedingly friendly and helpful, and our visit was one of the many highlights of our trip.",5.0,4.8656

732,Must do NY attraction,"Expensive for a family, but going to the 102nd floor is worth doing once. Whole experience is very well done, much better line experience than in the past.",5.0,4.703
733,A fun experience and recommend going to the 102nd floor,What a pleasant surprise! We did not expect all the added experience and were very surprised. Plus the staff was very friendly and kept everyone moving so lines were not bad. While it was expensive it was not over priced; definitely worth it.,4.0,4.8328
734,Insane,The 102nd floor was fascinating and absolutely terrifying at the same time. The videos played in the elevators were also very well produced.,5.0,4.0212
735,An NYC landmark,"This is a must for anyone touring NYC. This is the first real NYC skyscraper. I like the Art Deco interior. I have been here on two separate occasions. The outdoor observation deck on 86 is awesome. Panoramic outdoor views of all of NYC. The safety fence is strong yet not obstructive. Plenty to see. The 102nd floor was worth the extra money in my opinion. There may be newer slightly taller buildings to visit, but 1200’ is high enough to see parts of surrounding states on a clear day and definitely high enough to take in NYC. The express pass would only be worth it during a busy time. It’s hard to know when that is. The express pass allows you to get up to observation decks quicker, but you miss some things along the way. If you’re going on a weekend or during a time when people are off work and out touring, buy the express pass. The gift shop is complete. Filled with various good quality Empire State Building souvenirs. I recommend an ESB model. Ask for a “King Kong” at the register. The staff throughout the building were friendly and knowledgeable. There is only one ESB and it’s definitely worth visiting. For lunch or dinner stop in at “Little Italy Pizza” located just a couple minutes by foot from the ESB. Ask for the Grandma Slice. Don’t go to ESB on an empty stomach, it detracts from the experience. Take pictures and video of the building from street level before taking the tour. I’ve been on the tour at night time and during the day. Both times of day are worth it for various different reasons. Anytime of day a visit to the ESB is worth it. 102 was amazing. Not a big space but not as crowded due to the extra cost maybe? It’s a cylinder shaped area with floor to ceiling windows. Very cool.",5.0,4.9838000000000005
736,Great views,"NY's most iconic building and well worth heading up to take a closer look. Having previously been up the new WTC, Top of the Rock and the new Edge in Hudson Yards I was pleasantly surprised that each provided different views and perspectives of the city. Well worth while.",5.0,4.7914
737,A great visit in Manhattan,"Obviously the view from the 86th floor is great! But the exhibition/museum part before you get there is also excellent, lots to see and to do on the way up.
Getting in was also easy, no queues the day we went, and very simple and straightforward.
Not sure if the extra to go to 102nd floor would be worth it. Maybe just to say you've done it, but can't believe you can see much more.",5.0,4.741
738,Breath taking experience,It was amazing to be able to see all the places we went… but from above. A really good and fun experience!!,5.0,4.8408
739,Highlight of NY,"This was def the highlight of our trip! We really enjoyed the galleries and interactive art on the way up to the 86th floor.
The only thing was that there are not a lot of signs and staff yelled at us a couple of times for standing (confused) in the hallway of where to go. The security check was fine, but rude staff said they were cranky and yelled at my 10 year old niece who had no idea what to do & almost made her cry. Less than pleased with the staff interaction….if you’re going to work with people, then be nice to people - especially kids.",3.0,3.4842
740,Great Experience!,"Our group of 12 had a wonderful time visiting the Empire State Building. It did not feel overcrowded and the staff was super friendly and efficient with the crowd. We decided to climb the 6 flights of stairs from the 80th floor to the 86th in order to avoid the 30 minute elevator wait time. We did the same on the way back down. The views are breathtaking, plenty to see from when you first enter the building to your viewing spot and plenty of spaces for photos. Great time and highly recommend if you plan to visit NYC!",4.0,4.941

We arrived in time to watch the sun set and then stayed long enough to take a few photos of the night time views. The attendants were friendly and the whole experience was first rate. We've been multiple times, taking foreign visitors to explore the Big Apple and we always enjoy the Empire State Building experience.",5.0,4.9488

745,Those views though,My husband had never been to the Empire State Building. I had visited many times and I was excited for him to experience the views.

This is a must for any first time visitor or those who have been before. The views will never disappoint.,5.0,4.524
746,Great time!,"Husband and I came the 3rd of July for our anniversary celebration. Had lunch at Tacombi as part of the pre fix meal option. Was good food though limited menu items. Have to get juice and can not sub soda or tea instead without an additional price. The staff at the Empire State Building were knowledgeable, kind, respectful and polite. We had a great time even with the large crowds that were booked at the same time. I felt it was a tad pricey but I would do it again for sure. Thanks for giving us a great time, being open, and keeping us safe, secure and allowing us to have fun.",5.0,4.9748

We had a brilliant time, and the views on our very sunny day were just fantastic!",5.0,4.9155999999999995
755,Great Visit,"We visited soon after the building opened, so the lines were small and we were able to see all of the exhibits without feeling rushed by other visitors. Fantastic views, of course. My only criticism was that one viewing corner was taken by a Stranger Things photo op, and another corner was off limits, with a guard posted there so no one could look from that area. This greatly limited the ""choice"" viewing spots. If it had been the peak of the visiting hours, one could feel extremely frustrated by these off-limits spots in an already very small area.",4.0,1.3726

Great for families. The observatory is well maintained and spacious, but would recommend going during non-peak hours and closer to sunset if possible.",5.0,4.7238

You have already seen the view from two floors below so I’m not sure it’s worth the pretty hefty extra price. All said, the views are amazing and really give you an idea of the landscape of Manhattan and beyond. The exhibits are wonderful and really interesting.

784,Fantastic view. Had an anxiety attack due to withdrawal effects- Personnel handled it exceptionally well.,"We went to every possible level up to the 102nd one. Fantastic view and I don't think any other place can compete (Basicallly a 360 view on the 80th, the 86th and the 102nd level and you really see how expansive NYC is). I had recently quit a medication and I out of nowhere had an anxiety attack after a while (And I had it on and off for the rest of my stay in NYC, all is good now).

I must say that the personnel handled it exceptionally well and made sure I was as comfortable as possible and also called an ambulance for me so they could examine me (Once it was established it was very likely to be anxiety, I decided to not go to the hospital). One of the personnel in was a former police officer and I'd like to commend him for being great with helping me out and calming me down during the experience - It really felt like I was in safe hands. Likewise I recognized that one person followed me with the paramedics outside to make sure I was okay which also was fantastic.

While it was a shame that I started experiencing withdrawal effects in the Empire State Bulidng of all places (And I had it on and off for the rest of my stay in NYC, albeit they became milder and more brief with each day), I must say that the personnel did great and I could not have asked for a better handling of a situation which is probably very rare for them. I crossed off two things in the bucket list: Get to the top level of the Empire State Building as well as get into a NYC ambulance!

So:
View = Fantastic
How personnel handle anxiety (Or just medical emergiencies in general) = Fantastic

Thanks yet again!

One gripe was just the weather was very gloomy, so no sunset views but great night views from every floor. Unlike previous trips the elevator also stopped at the 80th floor. If you want a picture of yourself along with the night views, you'll need to turn flash on from your phone.

789,Empire Views,Booking through trip advisor was a breeze although the 102nd floor option needed to be purchased on sit for an additional fee from the kiosk on the 86th floor.,5.0,3.0
790,"Excellent experience, amazing views, Wow...","It's easy to walk past it and not realise it's there from the outside, but once you're in it is amazing, following the path through the lower floors tells you a little bit about the history of the building and of New York, the binocular viewers are amazing showing a little video snapshot of New York, Once on the viewing deck, the views are truly awesome and well worth taking the time to take it all in, my only gripe... it's a bit pricey..!",4.0,4.9568
791,Beautiful views. Easy access.,"Beautiful views. Easy access with tickets. Trip advisor makes it easy! Thanks for the great, easy to follow directions.",5.0,4.9266000000000005
792,Overrated,"We done all the tall buildings in New York and this was definitely our least favourite. I found it to be very over rated, you'd be better at the top of the rock (great view of empire state building from there)",2.0,4.5012
793,Not to be missed,"I was very impressed with the information and trail up to the top viewing platforms.

It was the perfect way to spend my birthday.",5.0,4.6714
794,Great visit,All things were good but no food as soon as you enter in line you have come down have any kind of food,4.0,2.5712
795,Definitely must see,"We walked from Times Square to Macy’s and it was pretty easy to find it from that point. Definitely worth to visit, easy to follow the crowed to find the entrance. We didn’t go all the way to the highest part, but was still amazing views of New York.",5.0,4.82
796,See the Sunrise!,"While you have to get there super early, it is worth it to see the sunrise from the 86th floor of the Empire State Building! It's a neat experience to be in the building virtually alone -- no lines and no waiting. We lucked out and got an absolutely beautiful morning.",5.0,4.7905999999999995
797,Awesome Experience!!,"We had such a great time visiting the Empire State Building!!! Everyone that worked there was so nice and pleasant!! They all made the experience that much better by being so friendly, helpful and giving great customer service!!

798,Still a top attraction,"Visited with family in June 2022
Booked in advance - the stewards were very helpful.
Last visited over 25 years ago - a great place to view the city",5.0,4.6032
799,Nice Story and good view but little expensive,"The story around the building and the process was great, the views too but the other viewing decks had a better expieriences for the money",4.0,4.5012
800,Amazing,"What a great view of New York. I do love the place. The staff was so kind and friendly, they even helped us taking some pics. The access was so organised.",5.0,4.9052
801,Must Visit,Had a great time. Lots of fun things to do and learn throughout the experience. Loved the King Kong feature with the arm. Also appreciate them returning items that you can't bring with you up the elevator like a pocket knife. Cannot say the same with Statue of Liberty. Staff is extremely nice and the line processing is efficient.,5.0,4.9542
802,"Yes, yes and Yes!",Definitely worth hitting once! The views atop the Empire state are worth the money and time you spend on it. The staff is friendly and the team has focused on making the entire journey up the building an experience. We personally did not shell out the extra money for the 102nd floor and were happy with the 86th but one thing we would definitely recommend is trying to go during sunset as the views are amazing.,5.0,4.9304
803,Amazing customer service,"Guillermo Peña and the staff at the Empire State Building were amazing! So helpful and welcoming. This was the best service I have received anywhere. I highly recommend visiting. Not only is the view incredible, the people help make the experience memorable.",5.0,4.928
804,Empire's Great!,"Great staff, especially the gents on the main door and 86th floor. Visited at 8.30pm, (June, 2022), with no prior booking, stood in line for 15 mins, reached viewing area by 9.05pm ... busy, but got lots of pics. Weren't rushed in any area. Night views amazing. I'd recommend One World Tower for daytime views.",5.0,4.782
805,State visit,"I booked the Premier experience on-line from the UK, from start to finish the experience was excellent. Easy to book, easy to get to and the guide was amazing - thank you Renita you were awesome",5.0,4.9266000000000005
806,Amazing,It was very interesting and the view was great ! We had some wonderful pictures ! The children were impressed by the high view of all the buildings,4.0,4.8759999999999994
807,Stunning surprise when so many rip-offs are awaiting tourists these days...,"First, the view, which I've seen before but... it's just stunning and takes time to process, especially at night, which I'd recommend as the best time to go. The price, not cheap but not unfair. Second, we improvved this at the last minute while eating dinner. So we speed-walked to the ESB around 10:30 at night, having just phone-purchased the tix, uncertain that it would go through in time. But it did, and with a battery at 1% as we arrived, staff was excellent at ushering us through before the phone died :) Great visit.",4.0,4.895
808,Ace attraction,"The walkthrough museum was ace, view from 86th floor outstanding. Staff very helpful and prebooking worked well",5.0,4.6958

So we’ll organised, for so many visitors, it just keeps moving, not too much waiting.",5.0,4.6872
810,Meh,"Your employees are more interested in herding cattle to the next profit center than they are in providing a positive experience. But the worst part was Tacombi, where the service is indifferent. And that's especially sad because the food was very good. Maybe your management should take the Freedom Tower tour, which was 100 times better (and also cheaper).",3.0,4.5496
811,Line was poorly controlled,"Line was poorly controlled. When we arrived there were two lines, and no indication which one was to buy tickets and which one was for ticket holders, many people were in the wrong line because no one was providing any guidance and there was no signage. There were too many people on the viewing platform so it was hard to get a spot to see. When we were leaving an employee told us we should take the stairs it's only five floors she didn't tell us five floors was the equivalent of 10 floors because of the size of the floors. And then when we got down five floors it was unclear where to go, one of the employees made a sarcastic remark 'oh you're gonna take the wrong elevator do you want to go up to the top again haha' Not my fault there are no signs tour employee guidance!",2.0,1.2182
812,Amazing Trip,"Great time we spend over there and amazing experience , we visited with all family and all of them enjoyed the experience",5.0,4.8084
813,Best place for views !,"I’ve gotten the express line ticket but sometimes you don’t need to because of the crowd. You can always get the tickets inside the area.

I went up to 102nd floor as my ticket permits me there. But on the 80th floor (if I remember correctly) that’s where you get to experience the outdoor feeling of the building! Prior to that, you’ll go for a museum tour which is amazing!

Then to 102nd floor, that’s where you get a perfect view of Manhattan! You get the soo the greens of Central Park and from a distance you can see Statue of Liberty too!

Recommended coming here!",5.0,4.9361999999999995
814,Fun and informative,This tour was very fun and informative!! I highly recommend it for anyone going to New York. The views are breathtaking!,5.0,4.7648
815,Empire State Building,A great experience with a lot more interactive information than the last time I went (16 years ago). I suggest booking first thing in the morning before it gets super busy.,5.0,4.6804
816,Empires State Building VIP Tour - Renita Rocked It!,"Our family of 5 scheduled this tour in advance. On day of tour, we received a call from Renita stating the view was not good (cloudy) and rescheduled us for later in the day hoping for better weather. Renita was right! She gave us instructions for when/where to arrive and all in reception area knew her. She guided us into the green room and told us about the art, the tour and what to expect. She guided us around the building telling us about the building, events which occurred there and really made us feel like VIPs! She took us around never feeling rushed, ensured we could get pictures taken without waiting and was super-friendly in ensuring we got the right pics as couples and as a family. It was my sister-in-laws birthday and led us in a rendition of Happy Birthday--how many people get that! And all while pointing out landmarks, the best views and best areas for pics. The tour and Renita were outstanding and have already recommended her to friends going to New York. Renita made us feel special and we regarded her as a true friend as we included her in our pics too! Thank you Renita--you're the best!!",5.0,4.9846

818,Cool view!,Nice view but 102th floor it's not necessary - 86th is totally fine. So no sense to spend extra money.,4.0,2.9506
819,Beautiful,The sunset was beautiful! I wish it was a little less crowded up there but eventually we saw most everything.,5.0,4.1124
820,Empire State Building,"Iconic building, has to be visited. Very well organised and some great interactive, informative pieces as you progress round. Spectacular views of the New York skyline from the top. Well worth a visit. 👍",4.0,4.84
821,Magnificent views!,"The views from the top of the Empire State Building were everything we expected...magical! The fun activities on the way up to the lift were an unexpected bonus.
The only negative thing for us was the waiting outside in the street to actually go into the building. We arrived just before our timed slot, but it seemed pretty disorganised when we got there, we couldn't really understand why we couldn't line up inside where there was plenty of space. Once inside the building, we felt rushed to get to the lift up to the top, but once we were up there we could pretty much spend as much time as we wanted.",4.0,4.8532
822,"The one, the only. Empire!","Last time we were in NY there was really only two choices for observation decks in NYC. So when I asked my teens why they chose Empire they said, “It’s the Empire State Building”, and “its outside”. It remains an iconic building, and a timeless monument to the workers who built it. If you plan time for the Empire exhibit, or read about the construction time period you will more appreciate this construction feat.",5.0,3.9152
823,Amazing Experience and Awesome Tour Guide,"Not only was this an amazing and memorable experience, our tour guide Renita Edmond was just absolutely great. She really brought the experience alive and made every moment of the tour greater then the last. She took each of the tour members into consideration and was conscientious of their needs and wants. The trip was fantastic and 100% worth going on.",5.0,4.9142
824,A great experience!,The exhibits on the way to the elevators were very nice. I enjoyed learning about how the Empire State Building was built and what life was like in NYC in the 1930s. Staff was friendly and helpful. Of course the views did not disappoint!,5.0,4.899
825,Breathtaking,"If you have never been to NYC, nothing will prepare you for how the view strikes you when you walk out the doors on the 86th floor at night! It's one of those things that you can't use words to explain.",5.0,2.1602
826,Overpriced Tourist Trap,"1. $44 for the 82nd floor observation deck or $71 for the 101 floor view. The cheaper one is good enough.

2. RUDE security. Be prepared to be disrespected by TSA rejects.

3. The actual guides (same uniforms as security) are actually courteous and helpful.

4. Beautiful views of Manhattan and beyond.

Interesting, just not worth the money.",2.0,4.615
827,Loved every minute!,"Everything about my Empire State Building Visit was wonderful! The staff was polite and helpful and the views were amazing at all levels and from all sides! I wished I would have spent more time in the exhibits on the way up, but I was too excited to get to the top!",5.0,4.7926
828,Outstanding,"A visit to the Empire State Building is always a pleasure. The pre- observatory exhibits are interesting (and several features- like the 'live action' street views through binoculars, and King Kong! are fun for all ages. The staff is attentive and welcoming. And the views, of course!!!",5.0,4.8914
829,"good, but not beyond compare","The view is beautiful, but the problem is: first, it is not easy to take a picture of yourself because you will be surrounded by steel bars; second, it is possible to gain similar scene elsewhere.",4.0,3.2008
830,A must,"A must, a pretty great place to know more about NY. Only improve the instructions of the tickets. It’s not very clear.",5.0,4.6632
831,Great insightful tour!,Ms Renita was so kind and displays her true affection for the Empire State Building throughout the tour. She is very knowledgeable and professional.,5.0,4.7804
832,Empire State Building,It’s been just shy of 20 years since I’ve last visited NYC. The amount of change in that short period of time is amazing. A lot has changed since my last visit as well. My fiancé and I loved our visit. It was her first and all the pictures we got came out great too!,5.0,4.843
833,Gorgeous night views!,The staff was and everything runs so smoothly. It was a favorite part of our trip for our teen children. would definitely go again!,5.0,4.4354
834,Beautiful views and nicely organized experience,"Beautiful, well-organized, informative experience! This was my family & I’d first time to the Empire State Building, and we found the entire experience to be absolutely stunning and beautiful. The views, the museum and artifacts, the history behind it, and even the staff members who dressed in matching attire- all of it makes up the whole experience. This is a must see in NYC!!",5.0,4.8316
835,Awesome experience!,Amazing experience and very well organized!! It’s a must see if you are visiting New York!! Loved all the movie references were presented.,5.0,4.8108

837,Fantastic. Historical. Magical.,"Loved the entire experience. Took our three kids (5, 11, 13) and everyone enjoyed the visit. Quick trip up. No issues with lines and we loved the sights and historical information. Truly a must do in New York!",5.0,4.84
838,Wonderful,It was great!! The staff were very knowledgeable about the building and its history. The displays were very interesting.,5.0,4.6522
839,Fantastic Family Experience,Family excursion while in NYC and well worth the price of admission! I would definitely recommend purchasing the trip to the 102nd floor! The sights are breathtaking! Wish we had scheduled a return trip for a nighttime experience.,5.0,4.8594
840,Such an awesome trip! Renita is awesome!,It was a random visit… we purchased the 102flr tickets and had a fun time learning about the Empire State Bldg. The best part of our visit was meeting one of the employees Renita at the very top. She was extremely fun to chat with and took some photos for us. Literally made our day and visit 100x better!,5.0,4.888

843,"Effective, nice and fantastic","I booked this for my sons and my husband. Loved that you had to book a time spot. We arrived a bit late but was greeted by a kind man at the entrance that told them to go ahead. Inside the same procedure - kind people waved them to the elevator and up to the most amazing view ever!!! An epic moment for my sons and husband. Due to the high price I chose to wait outside for them, though I would love to go with them. I have been there so many times before I felt comfortable wit letting them have this experience together. The look on their faces when they came down again told me everything - they had an fantastic time!!! Thank you, oh beautiful Empire State Building ❤",5.0,4.9878
844,Love it!,Vwri nice experience. So beautiful but so many people so i can't take a nice picture of tbe sunset in the upper level.,5.0,4.6036
845,A Must See,Even with all of the new buildings to go to and see the Empire State Building is a MUST SEE since it has been in so many movies and is the ORIGINAL since 1931!,5.0,4.0294
846,Amazing,+5 stars. Loved every part of this experience. Super clean. Museum was great. Elevator ride up to the 86th floor was so smooth. View unbeatable. Worth every penny.,5.0,4.8954
847,The Empire State Building is a must!,We purchased the express tickets for the sunset time frame on a Thursday. It wasn’t too busy at that time so we could’ve saved money with just the regular admission tickets. It was worth it though. Great experience and views!,5.0,4.7078
848,Excellent Experience,"We had such a great time! Tickets were easy to get, there were no lines, and the information leading up to the top of the Empire State Building was organized in such an engaging way.",5.0,4.7032

It made our visit truly memorable.

851,Definitely a must see,Not just another observatory. Everything was spectacular. You'd feel the grandeur of the1930s New York blend in with the modern times. Booking tickets was easy. The staff was very helpful. Nice items in the gift shop.,5.0,4.8736
852,Highly recommended,"Could see whole of New York and plus further, was amazing view and visit, weather was beautiful and the views was stunning",5.0,4.7668
853,Even better than expected!,"I haven't been up the Empire State Building in 40+ years, and was pleasantly surprised. What an upgrade! I had a great time taking my son through and learning the history of the building. The exhibits we're well done and fun even for.my 8 year old. I would.absolutely recommend visiting this iconic site.",5.0,4.8918
854,Amazing!,"Amazing attraction, worth the extra money for the 102nd floor! Try to go on sunsets. Really entertaining the museum before the floors",5.0,4.8078

856,ESB experience keeps getting better,"While we have been many times this was the first visit for our boys (ages 10 and 12). ESB continues to invest in their guest experience; loved the history tour, ESB in the movies and media section plus pictures with Godzilla. Roof top views are superb and Floor 102 in the tower is so cool now. One of our favorite spots in NYC. Thanks for a great visit!",5.0,4.9444
857,Good visit - never got digital pics I paid for,The visit was great. People friendly. But I paid $36 for a photo package that was supposed to include digital images emailed to me. Never received.,3.0,4.1294
858,Manhattan under my feet,"A great day to visit the Empire State Bldg, as weather was great and clear. We could see forever, but the price of the ticket was 30% more than what was advertised, so we paid a lot more for four people than originally thought.",4.0,4.4192
859,I’m a New Yorker. This is worth a visit.,Extremely well designed exhibits and friendly staff. Definitely worth the extra fee to get to the 102nd floor (inside) as well as the classic 86th floor (outside). My preschooler was amazed and would have spent all day there. Absolutely perfect.,5.0,4.914
860,Spectacular views,"We booked the first time slot (9:00AM) and it was well worth it. No lines, and we only bought our tickets a few days in advance. The views from the 80th and 86th floors were breathtaking. We paid extra to go to the 102nd floor… and while I loved the trip up and the views just as much, I don’t think we got any better vantage point that high than we did on the 86th floor (outside). Everyone but the people selling pictures were pleasant to interact with… the folks selling pictures were very short with us, not very helpful, and were very cold.",4.0,4.5724
861,Empire Doesn't Strike Back,"This was an excellent tour that focused on its construction. It was windy on the 86th floor observation deck, but clear. The 106th(?) floor was an even greater view.",5.0,4.7378
862,Excellent fun!,Was not expecting this to be such a fun and amazing visit! A definite must for every first visit to NYC.,5.0,4.7176
863,Expensive View,"Nice museum, fabulous views, but very pricey. $117 for 2 of us and we only went to the 86th floor. To get the most for your money, go right before sunset and stick around to see the city light up.",4.0,3.9534000000000002
864,"Same classic view, weird new levels of lines to stand in","The last time I visited the Empire State Building, over 20 years ago, we took an elevator up and stepped out on the top level. This time we had to pass through several strange floors of dark and fluorescent lighting with unclear purpose before we got to the top. I am sad about that, I guess.",4.0,1.9788
865,A must-see for anyone visiting NYC,"The view is breathtaking and because you're in the middle of the city, you can see everything and it all looks so close. I didn't think you'd be able to see the city so clearly in pictures, but you can. But, I've got to say that the most special thing about visiting the ESB is the wonderful staff that makes everyone feel really special! Everyone we encountered went out of their way to be really cordial and made us feel like VIP's! Thanks for a great visit!",5.0,4.9719999999999995

870,Overpriced and unnecessary for the skip the line express,"Do not pay extra for this skip the line express ticket if you are able to show up near when they open (10 am). The lines are NOT long and you really don't need to pay double just to get ahead of a few more people. There were no attendants at the express red carpet line and several times, we were just sent to the regular line. Our time slot was for 10:15 am. Perhaps it would be useful if you are going at the height of the season and mid day. I wish I can get some money back.",1.0,4.2228
871,Amazing experience!!!,"We had an incredible view, sunsets with a clear sky! The essence worked without any problems, no waiting, no lines and we stayed up there for one and a half hours!",5.0,4.606

873,Great Tour in a Nostalgic Building,"We have made several trips to New York over the last decade as we have family living in the area. Going to the top of the Empire State Building has never been something we have done, although we have been to the top of some of the newer buildings to see their observation decks. But, this is New York City and this is THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING.
As kids, my brothers and I would surmise what it would be like to drop a penny from the top? What kind of damage might it do to something on the street level. ""I bet it would crush a taxi cab"" was one of our theories.
We visited on a weekday late afternoon in late May. The tourist crush was not heavy and the lines to get in the building and queue up - non-existent.
The staff was most courteous and helpful and getting us moved through and I wished we hadn't spent extra dollars for skipping the lines - there were no lines! The uniformed staff give the proper sense of time, history and elegance of the property. It makes one wonder how much longer people will hold this skyscraper in awe.
The museum exhibitions on the way to the top are informative and enjoyable to read through and observe. It gives you a great sense of the time during construction and then history of the building. After all, this is THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING.
The views from the observation decks were great, but not that much different than other towers observation decks would provide. But we were atop what has probably been the most famous building in Americana.
I would recommend going. Yes, there are taller buildings. Yes there are slicker entertainment portions of taller buildings. But one will never experience the nostalgia in these. After all, this is THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING!",5.0,4.9836
874,Something's missing in the view....,"....and that's just the iconic building you're on top right now.
NYC skyline is crippled without the Empire, that being the only reason I deduct one star.
By no means, don't let that defer you from visiting the world's most famous skyscraper.
On the contrary, it will reward you with life time memorable views, as it has the most central position on Manhattan.
TIPS:
1. if you have pre booked time slot entry tickets and weather is bad, rebook them.
That was a case with us having the tickets for May 2, when you couldn't see the top of ESB due to clouds, fog and rain. They rebooked us for tomorrow with no issues when weather was fine.
2. buy the tickets for around 1-2 hours before sunset time. In that way you can enjoy both, day and night views.",4.0,4.2943999999999996
875,Must go!,The Empire State Building 86 floor level was wonderful. Incredible views. Well organized. Easy admission. Loved it.,5.0,4.75
876,Best view ever!,Best view ever! I truly believe that nothing will top the view and feeling I got while being on top of the Empire State Building. We used the Go City Explorer Pass to get in and I had also previously booked a sunset time for an additional fee which was totally worth it. Entrance worked perfectly according to our reserved timeslot. The staff was so friendly!,5.0,4.9106000000000005
877,Empire view to an empire city,"Very well-organised sightseeing experience: no waiting in long-lines, no hustle to get in. It’s not worth to buy the express line you do not spare significant time there is no particular difference. Buy city pass instead of regular admission ticket it is certainly cheaper. I booked a time slot on advance - was no difference nobody checked or cared for it. Excellent view of upper and lower Manhattan, great exhibition on the way to the top.",5.0,4.0974
878,Still a New York icon,"Took a Saturday bus trip to Manhattan. One of several landmarks I visited was this skyscraper that is one of the granddaddies of them all, the Empire State Building. Unbeknownst to me, reservations are required if you want to visit the observatory so I was unable to do so this time, but just seeing the edifice up close and in person added another check to my bucket list.

To say the architecture has stood the test of time would be an understatement. In fact a good many of today's more modern tall buildings have borrowed several features from this one.

The landmark tower at the top which can be viewed from miles away tells you this is indeed the Empire State Building. It's also a 10-minute walk for most people from Times Square.",5.0,4.5367999999999995
879,Still the Best,"For us, still the best way to get atop of NYC. Great view all around the building on 86th floor. You can see both Lower and Upper Manhattan from here.",5.0,4.5928
880,Staff were helpful and funny,"I was booked with Viator through Experience First and because of this we could rebook since our scheduled time was Rain and Fog. Staff will warn you that you can't see and were really helpful to rebook and were super funny. On the day we went back there was no lines, staff that day were helpful too and funny too so i figure it's ta thing, staff encouraged to be themselves. Love it! The tour itself was a little underwhelming.",4.0,4.9302
881,Awesome,This was expensive but worth it! We paid $200 for 2 people! The staff are all wearing vintage 1920’s uniforms. The entire staff right down to the gift shop were super friendly! It was refreshing to see so many people enjoying their jobs! The whole experience was amazing! They have great picture opportunities with King Kong too! Nice history exhibit of how it was built too! We went to 102floor and yes it was slightly scary but worth every penny! I don’t recommend kids younger than 12.. would be a total waste of money.,5.0,4.9852
882,A must,Book a slot to visit. I went at 9am on a Sunday and it was already busy. probably a right of passage for all visitors,5.0,3.0
883,An 86th Floor View is Plenty Good,"If nothing else, you can come here pending weather, to get great views of the NYC metro area from their 86th floor observatory deck. I was struck by how touristy the whole setup is for visitors including all the multitude of Art Deco era dressed attendants and the directed gift shop walk through. But they've had decades of experience, and it's still popular, and it works. The museum also has a lot of historical info and videos. There's a $44 fee to get to the 86th observatory deck and a much heftier $77 fee to get to the indoor 102nd floor 360 degree observatory deck. We choose the 86th floor deck and it was plenty good viewing of this great city. In fact, no one I subsequently asked could tell me what was worth paying another $33 pp for lol. Anyway the Pro-Tip is that the 86th floor observation deck is plenty good and plenty worthwhile for a one time visit to ""the world's most famous building"".",5.0,4.9612
884,Visit at Night,"Would highly recommend visiting at night as the views over the city are stunning
Be aware it gets busy up there at night

885,Awesome!,"Perhaps the most iconic building in NYC History...! 100% recommended. Go visit, you won't be disappointed. Loved every minute.

Fantastic!",5.0,4.7856000000000005
886,Must visit!,"If you’re in New York be sure to include this on your to do list! We went up to the 86th floor at Sunset and the views do not disappoint. We were expecting a queue and whilst we did have to wait for about 15 mins we were promptly allowed in and got through security quickly before heading up to the viewing platform.

You go to a small museum at the bottom of the building first and then take a lift to the 80th floor, then you go up to the 86th floor. You can upgrade your ticket to the 102nd floor if you wish once you are up there but we decided to stay put at the 86th floor. When you come back down you arrive at a gift shop where you can purchase ESB related souvenirs and there is lots to choose from! Fairly reasonable prices too.

Definitely book tickets online ahead of time as it is much more straightforward on the day.",5.0,4.8309999999999995

888,Excellent way to spend time in NYC,"Went to the Empire State building today and did the 102 and 86th floor tours. Both of them were just excellent. The weather was clear, the crowds small and the views were SPECTACUTLAR.

894,Great experience,"This is a must for anyone visiting New York. The views are unparalleled. The history and exhibition parts are interesting, but it’s when you get to the top outside that it impresses. I took some other tips and got there early, for 9am. This meant we didn’t have long lines at the bottom and uninterrupted views. As we were leaving after about an hour, people were beginning to have to wait behind others for views and photos. Also, get your ticket beforehand online- another time saver on the day",5.0,4.604

It is busy, so we bought VIP tickets which is well worth doing.

The only downside is the day we went, it was raining and visibility was poor. However, it was still an excellent experience and one I would highly recommend.",5.0,4.7308
901,Memorable Night Views,"The staff are professional and herding the large group of people felt like a well oiled machine. The 9pm time slot was very nice.

It was amazing and made us really appreciate the grandeur of NYC.",5.0,4.926
902,Very Commercialized,"Been here before, but this time it is much more commercialized with prop's, long lines and crowded rooms. The view is fantastic, especially at night. Pricey, especially if you want to go to the top. When you arrive, there is a kiosk to reserve a time. Not sure why, they are not on a schedule. It took about 45 minutes to go through security, wait in crowded lines and elevators. VERY FEW WORE MASKS! There is a maze of trash and trinkets you have to go through before exiting.",3.0,4.7438
903,"Amazing experience, a must visit in New York!","The Empire State Building was a fantastic experience from start to finish, and it must be said, one of my favourite buildings in the world. It’s incredibly iconic, and the highly interactive museum experience before you head to the top is brilliant. They bring to life the entire construction process, alongside iconic moments in the building’s history.

Once you finally get to the top, the view speaks for itself. Wherever you look, there is an epic view to be seen. Make sure you leave space in your New York itinerary for this stunning masterpiece. Do it as early as you can to avoid the big queues too, we only waited a few minutes to enter when arriving just after 9am.",5.0,4.9033999999999995

From the beginnen of construction of the building until the recent renovations and a ever changing skyline. My teens enjoyed the 'King Kong section' on the tour.

912,Truly Remarkable,"Though I was unable to make it to the day part of this tour, the night was a stunning experience of the ""city that never sleeps."" There is so much more to see and learn than just going to the 86th observation deck for the view.",5.0,3.7636
913,An experience like no other!,"We booked the sunrise ticket for two reasons; firstly, the idea of watching the sunrise over NYC from the Empire state building promised some pretty spectacular photos and secondly, the tickets are limited to 100 guests so we knew it would be quiet up there for this viewing, having been before I know it can get quite crowded up there at peak times.
When we woke up that morning to a dense fog we were slightly disappointed but headed over no the less. Well we should not have been concerned as the fog gave a set of spectacular photos and an experience like no other, the sight of the other skyscrapers of Manhatten peaking out of the clouds was unreal.
The staff were amazing, when we arrived and checked in we were warned that there was no visibility and we would not get to see the sunrise and offered to either rebook for another Saturday sunrise or go on up and then also get a return ticket for later that day. We chose to go up.
We were escorted up by KEVIN who was extremely friendly and gave us the VIP treatment all the way up to the top.",5.0,4.8784

Went to the four main observation decks in my time in NYC (Empire State, Top of the Rock, World Trade Centre, and the Edge) using my sightseeing pass - and this was the least impressive

Being older, the spaces for tourists were very cramped and I didn’t think the view was particularly special - one of the best things about the NYC skyline is seeing the ESB - therefore would recommend going to another observation desk to take in the building itself",3.0,4.6624

You go in another lift when you go up to floor 86 and get “the view” from the pictures. Great view all round Manhattan. We had a 9.30am slot, was no queue or wait to get in.",5.0,4.8393999999999995
921,Disappointing,"Unfortunately we could not see a thing. I know the weather cannot be predicted but I do feel that there should be some conversation by the staff to let customers know as they come in that there is literally NO view? And ask if we would like to rearrange?

Instead we were made to believe that a view was there and were able to waste our money going up the top to see absolutely NOTHING- I kid you not. Not even the moon, nothing.

Waste of money. Would have liked to rearrange for when weather better but this was not offered to us. Resulting in us missing out on the views of nyc when this was a once in life time trip.",2.0,4.2876

The security staff were swearing about guests coming through security calling them “F***ing dumb”, the ticket lady raised her voice at me and spoke to me like a child being punished in front of my children whilst the guy at the gates refused to help my family because he couldn’t operate the ticket and told us to go away as there’s nothing he can do. Eventually after numerous attempts to seek support he called a colleague who came over to assist and let us through who agreed that the tickets were valid and didn’t know what the problem was.

The one thing I wish had been included in the tour, was a more detailed history of the building's construction, cultural influence and the individuals connected with it.

943,A true American icon,"What can one say about this iconic building that has not already been said?

Not much, I suspect.

Except that: the day we went to visit the 86th floor, we know it was misty - we were wearing raincoats that day! - but we went to the top anyway. The City Pass allowed us up to the 86th floor and to upgrade to visit the 102nd floor seemed slightly a forlorn hope, so we stuck with walking round the misty 86th.

And, you know what, it was great fun anyway. There are not many places where you can be high enough to walk in a wet cloud, but the Empire State Building is one of them.

Occasionally, there was a bit of a break in the cloud and you could see to the ground but it was fascinating to see how quickly the wind would move the mist around to ensure that view was obscured!

The Art Deco influences inside the building are worthy of note and, purely on the architecture alone, you don't need to see outside.

A great visit, with polite, professional guides - even those that were stationed outside with rain capes on!

Although the City Pass gave us the right to come back to continue the visit at 8pm, we were otherwise engaged but didn't feel as though we had missed out.

A must-do if in New York.",5.0,4.9746
944,disrespectful level of professionalism,"I recently visited the Empire State Building on a school trip from the UK. The experience up until this point was amazing. The staff were accommodating and friendly and travelling up the building itself was everything I would’ve hoped for with my group.

When we reached the 86th floor we came out the elevator and were greeted by two doormen who were letting the visitors in and out of the viewing point. As we visited the Empire State in the evening of an extremely windy night we got chatting to the staff about the conditions outside. I was stood with one friend of mine whilst she asked “would the wind knock us over if we go outside” to which he responded with “well, your friend would be able to hold herself up a lot more than you could”. Confused, I asked “did you just call me fat and my friend skinny” to which I was greeted with the response, after being scanned head to toe with his eyes, “well yes, I can just tell that by looking at you.”

I am very obviously a teenage girl. I am seventeen and still in full time school. For a middle aged man to feel obliged to compare my size to my friends was shocking. As someone who has previously struggled with an eating disorder I was in complete and utter shock that a total stranger would even feel the need to comment on a young teenage girls body such as my own.

I may also add I am a UK size 8/10. I am by no stretch of the imagination “fat” and to plant this idea in a teenage girls head was absurd. I did not only feel disrespected but also uncomfortable, the last thing a staff member should be worried about is the weight of their young visitors bodies. Instead of simply answering the question about the wind outside, I was instead hit with a back handed and out of pocket comment regarding my appearance.

Some may see this issue as minuscule but the confidence knock it gave me as a young girl is incomprehensible. As a staff member their job was to educate us on the building and be accommodating to us, it was of no place for them to comment on my appearance and compare me to my friend.

I left this excursion feeling embarrassed and self conscious and it has put me of returning to the Empire State Building again.",2.0,4.619

Enjoyed the different experiences on the different levels. I would recommend the extra money to visit the 102nd floor if you can stretch to it. The views are unmatched.

My top tip is visit first thing in the morning. There was no queue, we got straight in the lifts and it wasn't busy at the top. I have seen pictures where people are shoulder to shoulder, I did not have this experience. There was plenty of space.

It is a must see if you visit New York. It was a highlight of my trip.",5.0,4.937
946,It has a fantastic view of New York.,Apart from the waiting it was worth the visit . You have to pre book a time slot even if you already have a ticket or a city pass. We booked 815pm . We arrived at 740pm and joined a queue for the 815 time . They let us in about 8pm then had to wait in another queue. After removing belts jackets and phone for security check we then could enjoy the sights. The elevator takes you to the 80th floor .. if you get a chance film the elevator ceiling because a great video plays. You reach the 80th floor and enjoy the views behind glass . So photos get the glass reflections. Save you time because you then take the elevator to the 86th floor . No glass just metal railings you can avoid with your camera to take amazing pics . You can then go to floor 102 if you have paid extra. Is it worth the price ? Yes I would say so.,4.0,4.9506

After passing through security (which was a bit much) we arrive at the elevator and off to the the first stop on the 80th floor , I can not begin to tell you how amazing the view is , we then head to floor 86 after walking through the museum type atmosphere that was on the 80th , when we stepped outside in the 86th and looked out over NYC at night it almost took my breath away , I couldn’t believe how beautiful it was , so if you’re asking yourself is $50 extreme for just an elevator ride the answer is NO , now we lucked up and were there at night which I can’t imagine why anyone would want to go any other time but hey do you.",5.0,4.7378

There was always an elevator waiting for us to bring us to the next level. You will have a great time on this tour. The weather was great and we had clear skies and good sights of all of New York. The modern exhibition and design combined with the old Art Deco was done really well. Renita was a wonderful, cheerful host with lots of experience, knowledge and great passion for her work and the Empire State Building. Thank you for giving us a marvelous experience!

951,More to explore on the way up to the top!,"My expectations were low however were exceeded, I imagined just going to the top for a nice view and it to be a quick experience that was over and done with quickly. However in the building there is loads of rooms you walk through before going to the top dedicated to the history of the building and fascinating facts to how it was built, the view from the top wasn't amazing because it was a cloudy evening however still worth it and I would say its a must do event when in NYC and definitely worth the money!",5.0,4.8468
952,No view,"Fine visit. But, due to fog in area, we had no view from the top. This was our second attempt to go. COVID-19 stopped our trip in December 2019.",3.0,2.2568
953,Incredible!,"I have been to the Empire State many years before, however, since my last visit the building has been completely revamped. There is a film narrating how the building came into being, showing workman constructing the building. I really enjoyed the lift right with the experience of moving up a building being built viewable through the ceiling of the lift. Excellent photo ops with professionals and also areas to pose for your own snaps. Best of all is your day entrance gets you free entrance go back at night and see the lights of New York. Also really pleased to see that the art deco side of the building still exists and it is absoluely stunning. Worth visiting to see that on its own. Well worth the visit.",5.0,4.9526
954,Greg & Kat’s Empire State Building Experience.,"The Empire State Building is one of the most amazing skyscrapers ever built and one of the world’s most iconic, renowned and revered attraction.

Fully constructed in 1931, the Empire State Building was designed by architectural firm, Shreve, Lamb & Harmon and has a height of 1,454 when including the building’s antenna.

Owned and operated by the Empire State Realty Trust, the Empire State Building
has been featured in a multitude of films and television shows, most notably the King Kong movie, which was released in 1933.

Due to its superb Art Deco architectural features, its cultural prominence and rich heritage, the Empire State Building has been listed on the National Register Of Historic Places and recognized as a National Historic Landmark

On Sunday, May 1st, 2022, I brought and treated myself and my wife for a visit to Empire State Building to celebrate our Happy Eight Year Relationship Anniversary!!! During our time there, we visited both the prominent 86th Floor Observation Deck and the beautifully designed 102nd floor. Our time at the Empire State Building was absolutely perfect and wonderful!!!

We took gorgeous pictures of New York City’s skyline and enjoyed outstanding views of many of the city’s popular destinations, ranging from Central Park, the Edge Observation Deck at 30 Hudson Yards, the Summit at the One Vanderbilt Building, the One World Trade Center, the Statue Of Liberty & the beautiful Hudson River.

The highlight of our visit was getting to see the building’s Art Deco style architecture, particularly on the ground floor, and our trip to the 102nd floor.

My wife is no fan of heights and she was a bit anxious when visiting the 102nd floor. Renata, an absolutely wonderful Empire State Building attendant deployed amazing charm, charisma and reassurance and successfully convinced my wife to stay on the 102nd floor and enjoy the amazing views of NYC.

I can’t thank Renata enough for her sense of humor, kindness, hospitality and exceptional service. She not only knocked out my wife’s fear and anxieties out of the park but also took amazing pictures of us with NYC in the background on the 102nd floor.

Both my wife and I had an extraordinary experience at the Empire State Building & will look back on our time there as one of our greatest and most cherished moments of our lives!!!",5.0,4.9936
955,You need to visit- so Iconic.,"One place I always wanted to go, think after watching so many films that included this mammoth building its always stayed with me. There was a lot of people when we visited however everything was handled quickly and we did not have to wait exceptionally long. Seems like a well-oiled wheel to be honest. We did venture up to 102, and so glad we did, the views were unbelievable. What is the point in going up so far and not getting to the top? Loved seeing the big King Kong visual. Awesome. I loved the doorman, he asked where I came from, after saying Scotland he quietly shows me his Celtic Keyring. So funny.",5.0,4.9622
956,Brilliant - stunning views,Brilliant experience - we went early-ish in the morning which beat the queue and we had plenty of space to take pictures. Staff were all friendly and the movement of people was really well managed. Amazing experience in the most famous building in the world,5.0,4.8508
957,Amazing Empire State Building Tour with Renita,"My husband won an all-access, behind the scenes tour during our stay in New York City and it was amazing. We were there for two hours and our guide, Renita Edmonds was fantastic! She has lived in New York City her whole life and she shared an incredible amount of information about the building. She was friendly and amiable. She knew all the best spots for taking pictures and helped us with that as well. Her pride in and enthusiasm for her city came through as we visited during this tour. Our view from the 102nd floor was breath-taking. I am not fond of heights, she knew that and helped me feel comfortable because her presentation was engaging and it captured my attention. The city is full of life and energy and she helped us appreciate it even more through her wonderful tour.

Thank you, Renita!",5.0,4.9830000000000005
958,Empire State building,Weather was fabulous on the day so the views were amazing. It's a great tour you don't feel rushed from area to area the staff are really friendly.,5.0,4.8824000000000005
959,Expensive and badly organised but what a view from the top,"My experience didn't start off well. I purchased two ""express"" tickets for the 86th and 102nd floor which cost a whopping $123 each which were bought directly from ESB's official website. We got tickets for 10am entry but when we got there the building wasn't open until 11! We got there 15 minutues before our 10am entry to find there was no separate queue for express ticket holders. There was one member of staff trying to organise and advise a large group of people outside who either already had tickets or were trying to get tickets - which wasn't clearly stated outside the building. I asked the one available member of staff (who was overwhelmed with people gathering around her for guidance) where to go as an express ticket holder. Thankfully, she allowed me and my partner to go straight to the front of the (already large) queue which made us feel uneasy as there were already express ticket holders who'd been queuing up longer only for us to march straight to the front.

We eventually gained access to the building 15 minutes or so after the building was due to open (at 11am) only to get to the security scanners where we had to queue up again for another 15 minutes or so. Once we got through the security scanners, we skipped the museum part on the way to the elevators (as we were keen to get to the top early before it got too busy). Once we got to the elevators, we then had to queue again for another 10 minutes or so! The queue wasn't due to people already using the elevators but because the staff were waiting on something or still getting things organised for when visitors did go upto the 86th floor.

Once we were up there it was amazing. It was a beautiful hot clear day and being one of the first ones up there made things even better as it was easier to get photographs and use the telescopes. We took pictures from all around the perimeter before heading upto 102nd floor - which luckily we didn't have to queue for being one of the first ones up. The view from there was just as amazing and got to see more of central park. Getting a nice picture looking out from the 102nd floor may be more difficult as you are within glass walls and do get light reflection from the glass. When we came back down from floor 102 to 86th, it was very busy.

If it was managed better and was cheaper in price, I would have given ESB a higher rating. It's a building I always wanted to visit since being a kid and glad I've done it but I doubt I'd visit again if I went back to NYC.",3.0,4.9894
960,Iconic Experience,It's iconic and a great choice for your observation deck views. We when on a clear day and you could see from the Atlantic Ocean all the way to the Mountains in NJ. Recommend going when they first open up before any crowds arrive. Really enjoyed the experience and recommend this place. There are a lot of Docents up on the platform to help direct and keep things orderly. We also went up to the 102nd floor which if its a clear day is so worth it. Would not upgrade unless it's clear with the sweeping views.,5.0,4.9482
961,Iconic Building still worth visiting,"Been up the ESB before, but a new wall to wall video display showing how the building was constructed brings the building to life",5.0,3.0
962,Great view of the city well organized feature,Got the tickets online the morning of our visit. The subway station was right near the ESB. The line moved very quickly and was super organized. Spent about 2 hours there. Really had a great time,5.0,4.7021999999999995
963,Still my favourite views of the city.,"I was here about 15 years ago and was impressed with the different add-on's. It still is hard to beat the views from the top, even though there are higher buildings. I think it's worth a visit. And the Art Deco style main foyer, where you exit, is just stunning!",4.0,4.614
964,"Iconic building, spectacular views, very expensive","My third trip to the Big Apple and I didn't feel it could pass without finally visiting this iconic building. Once there, of course, one should ascent and my family of four bought the admission tickets for both the 86th and the 102nd floor observation decks, the former being outside, the latter a floor to ceiling glass window experience.

It's expensive - $77 a head which is frankly outrageous for a couple of elevator rides, a museum and viewing floors but what are you going to do if you want to have this experience? However it is a lot of coin to drop if you have a family let me tell you. You do get a good experience though, it is fair to say. The museum charts the building of the tower and it is fascinating and well done with pictures and moving graphics that tell the remarkable story of construction. Imagine wandering around, 90 floors up, no hard hats or safety harnesses, wanging red hot rivets around. It's an amazing story and well told here.

Of course, one comes here to see the views from the top and we were fortunate to be there on a crystal clear day that disconcertingly reminded me of 9/11/01 and it is sad that this date is permanently seared on our psyches to this day, especially when in New York City. It doesn't help that I am not good with heights. At all. So it is weird that I would want to do this to be honest!

However, the views are indeed spectacular. One is whisked from the lobby to the 82nd floor and thence to the 86th where there is an open air observation deck from where the views are spectacular. However, once one has reached this level, it seems worth going up to the 102nd floor which is as high as one can go. This requires an extra ticket to access the solitary elevator up to said observation deck which is small and circular with floor to ceiling windows affording even more stunning vistas across NYC. For those of us scared of heights it is doable, but nonetheless terrifying!

Very expensive but it's definitely an iconic experience and the story of this wonderful building is definitely worth experiencing. It's such a shame that 9/11 haunts me every time I ascend this high in a skyscraper. Probably should not have visited the 9/11 memorial the day before from that point of view.",5.0,4.9838000000000005

967,VIATOR tickets not approved format,Terrible experience with VIATOR. Great experience at the Empire State once we go into the building. Tickets were not accepted by Empire State.

968,Great views,"Previously had viewed NYC from above at The Rock. I did enjoy the trip up the Empire State Building this time - the weather was great, views stunning and overall the waiting wasn‘t too bad. The one query is about the express tickets - I‘m not entirely sure that we did skip the line as they promised since we queued at every available point with everyone else. These queues did move relatively quickly but why pay to skip the line if you don’t skip the line?",4.0,3.8276
969,The Rain didn't keep us away,We really lucked out. It rained for about 2-3 hours before our scheduled time. When we arrived you could see the top of the building so we knew we would get a view so up we went. ZERO line!! When we got to the top the rain had stopped and the sun even peaked through the clouds for a little bit of a sunset. The clouds soon lifted and the night view of the city was stunning. So even if you encounter bad weather-if you can see the top of the building from the street you will get a great view of the city.,5.0,4.7166

The history of the building was really interesting, I didn't expect to have such an interesting ""museum"" type space on the way up. It was a sunny day and the views were spectacular.

985,Thank you Empire!,"The Empire is amazing. Not just the building but the amazing and friendly staff. My wife and I came here yesterday 4/15/22 for the first time and I bought tickets about one month out. The day I open my tickets up via email I didn’t realize the website glitch so poorly that it said I purchased it for Last month on the day I bought my tickets. I called Empire up, talk to Jerry and he told me to talk to his manager Abraham/Abrahim and explain the situation to him and he’ll help me out. I was like okay I’ll do that and just crossing my fingers that he can accommodate us. When we got there, the line at Empire was busy and I ask one of the staff member that I’m looking for Abraham the manager and where should I go? The staff member was radioing him and calling for him and out of nowhere another staff member Renita approached us and told us to follow her. She pulled us to the side, ask us about what’s going on and why we need to see Abraham. We told her about the situation and she then said okay no worries I’ll help delegate the situation. She took our tickets, went to a nearest system to scan our tickets just to make sure it wasn’t used. When it was confirmed that our tickets wasn’t used, she then told us we are all set and told us to enjoy the tour. The process was so quick and amazing that she made our night more amazing then it should have been at Empire.

Renita, I’m not sure if you’re going to read this but I just want to tell you that our first time in NYC, you’re the highlight of our trip. I truly cannot thank you for your friendly and efficient service to help and go beyond the extra miles (actually you went like 10-20 miles extra for us). We would never forget you, your kindness, and your service that again we wish that there’s more people like you especially where we live which is in Denver. I wish I could’ve saw you one more time to give you another big hug and give you another thank you because you’re an amazing person. After the initial encounter, my wife and I had a little teary eyes coming out just because during our trip we’ve been hurdling through multiple obstacles of travel related stress and issues earlier this week. So once again thank you so much Renita! God bless you! - Brandon and Michelle",5.0,4.9958

The 80th floor is great and open air, but it's crowded and there is wiring surrounding the edges so you have to take your photos in between wires. The 102nd floor is not open air, but glass enclosed and there were very few people up there. The views were spectacular. We purchased tickets online for an 11AM time and the lines outside were very long, but the staff was very much in control of the situation, directing tourists, ushering us along in the right direction, very friendly.

We spent quite a long time up there watching until the sky was absolutely dark. It was cold but there are heaters all around the top. The views are phenomenal from all sides.

I didn't get the package in my email right away after I paid, I asked the cashier, she was very impatient and said it will be in my inbox soon. So I trusted her, and left the building with some questions. 2 days pass by, and I still have not received the digital package in my email.

Staff were cool, calm and collected with making sure people got to where they needed to go. So many photo ops before you take the ride up to the observatory.

1019,Well worth it!,"My mom & I visited as a last minute decision. We were shopping at Macy’s and got online to see if there were tickets available. It was great! We had a reservation within the hour, the views were spectacular, and the history on the way up was perfect!! My only comment would be some of the workers were not very explanatory. They seemed to think you would know where to go and didn’t give enough detail. We were on like the 80th floor looking out through the windows and thought that’s what we paid for because we didn’t realize we were not on the 86th floor. We were getting ready to leave when an employee said have you gone upstairs yet? We almost missed out on going to the 86th floor. I just think that they need to give a little bit more direction. I didn’t see the correct option for what sort of visit it was. I chose family with teens but it was really just my mom who is in her 70s and myself who is in my late 40s.",5.0,4.5464
1020,Wedding anniversary present,"We are from England and in New York for our silver wedding anniversary. My wife has medical needs and I am her carer. We were told that carers are given complimentary tickets, however this seemed to cause a problem when we arrived, so I think this should be dealt with better. We had a fantastic meal at the State Grill and felt well and truly spoiled. As for the building - fantastic experience. Breathtaking views and a lovely building.",5.0,4.9372
1021,"Amazing views, lovely staff, way too expensive",Really gorgeous views in a building with fun and informative displays. The expense at 90$ a person for sunset viewing is more eye watering than the views tho so for us a once in a life time experience. Worth it I think but really costly in a way that is tough for families to justify. So if you want to go watch the weather and go at the absolute best time you can and spend as long as you want looking over amazing New York from this iconic building. Staff are efficient and friendly which is great.,4.0,4.9718
1022,Great Experience,"We paid to go to 102 floor and it was US$77 which is quite expensive for an experience that lasts less than an hour.
You can go to 86th floor where the view is still great and is $44",5.0,4.2498000000000005
1023,History with a view.,"Wonderful experience. The layout has you walking through time, as the construction goes on around you, you enjoy the views of the city.",5.0,4.569
1024,Nice views,"Great views from the top floor, quite a long queue to get there mind you but worth the wait. Incredibly cold and windy during the visit due to the season so be advised to wrap up warm and be prepared! Anyone visiting at night needs to take a tripod to get steady pictures as all of ours came out blurry due to hand movement.",3.0,4.8368
1025,Too Many People,"We were exploring on our first day and walked past the Empire State so I said ""Shall we go up?"" We had the GO City New York Explorer Pass so we had to use this to 'purchase' a ticket. The man was very helpful and showed us how to do this at the machine so we did not have to queue. Our tickets enabled us to go up straight away.

The lift was absolutely rammed full of people. Our tickets enabled us to go to the 96th floor. The lift takes you to the 90th floor which is the inside viewing platform and you need to take another lift to the 96th floor to the outside viewing platform. The queue for this lift was +30 mins so they were telling everyone to take the stairs. The views were amazing!! but the viewing platform is just too small for the amount of people they let up. We walked around but it was just too busy and you could not get to the 'front' as people were having full Instagram photoshoots everywhere. The queue for the lift down was very long so we walked down the stairs and then joined the queue for the main lift.

For something so iconic it was a bit of a let down. We had already done Top of the Rock in the morning and for me that was far superior.",2.0,4.8174
1026,Awesome!,"Thank you to the staff of the Empire State Building! You made a memorable experience for our seven year old nephew. Every person we encountered greeted us warmly and were ready to answer questions. The exhibits on the second floor sparked an interest for him in history and movies that we have been answering questions about all day! We knew it was great when he looked at the view and simply stated this is awesome!
Thank you.

Highly recommended!

1030,A spectacular way to end our visit.,"The people were friendly and the view was spectacular. Lots of extras to keep you occupied until you get up. They were very clean. Some idiot women sprayed confetti at the top, and they vacuumed it up right away.
We went up just before sunset. Perfect time but know that it will take about half an hour to walk around, get in and get up. Definitely recommended.",4.0,4.7048000000000005
1031,Amazing view from the 102nd floor,So being able to experience a clear but very windy afternoon from the 86th floor observatory was wonderful. The views from the 102nd floor were even more amazing. I recommend it!,5.0,4.9098
1032,Very nice,"I would say that this is not a busy place right now. We did not have to wait in line at all. There was ample opportunity to see the views on every side, and had almost no wait time to get an elevator. I felt comfortable the whole time I was up there, while I did not like the CN tower at all. There is a bunch of history at the bottom before you go up which is neat to see. There is also a few nice photo opportunities. This is my third time to NYC and my first time up to the top of the Empire State Building.",5.0,4.8118

1035,Great views/ scam to pay for skip the line,So the reason I gave it a low rating is that it is a scam these days to get the skip the line. Everyone is scheduled now so there really is not a line. DO NOT pay FOR THE SKIP THE LINE. The Empire State Building is well worth the cost to see. The museum at the bottom is one of the best museums we saw. The first stop is the 80th floor. It is enclosed and the views are fantastic. I felt like the trip up to the 87th floor to the open air views was really not that much different except you got to freeze to death and feel the wind whipping around. We did not go to the 102nd floor.,2.0,3.8794
1036,nobodys fault but there was no visibility,"we were unable to reschedule our visit and the weather was bad , nobodys faukt though but it is what it is",2.0,2.3858
1037,Great experience,It was more than expected with the muscat the bottom. The process was organized and took little time out the day. Great experience,5.0,4.2498000000000005
1038,Amazing views,"What an experience! I last visited 7 years ago, and so much has changed. So many more things to see on the way up, it was great. Previously I’d only went up to the 86th floor, but this time we went straight up to the 102nd. The view is insane, you can see the whole of the city, and more.

The shop on the way back down, has a great selection of items. And I love that there were Christmas decorations to purchase! Will definitely visit again",5.0,4.916
1039,Amazing building with great views,"We purchased tickets via CityPASS for a number of venues.
Arriving at the venue, slightly ahead of the allocated time, staff directed us in for a security check and verified the CityPASS for tickets.

The process was slick and efficiently carried out, a credit to the staff/security for this.

The exhibits showing the buildings history and construction were amazing. This was then topped, with panoramic view of the city from the viewing balcony.",5.0,4.7914
1040,Couldn't see anything,"We visited New York for a week, due to covid the website said we had to book tickets in advance. We booked for one of the evenings so we could see New York lit up at night. Unfortunately it rained the day we were due to go up and the cloud was very low. When we got to the Empire State Building we asked if we could exchange our tickets for another day due to the visibility but we were told no exchanges or refunds. We were incredibly disappointed as when we got to the top all we could see was fog. We felt it was a poor service when asked to book online in advance you can't guarantee the weather, in normal circumstances we would have purchased tickets on the day. We didn't want a refund just an exchange and we felt robbed of $90! All the staff were lovely and we couldn't fault them, they were all apologetic but their hands were tied due to unfair policy.",2.0,1.2212
1041,Amazing!,"We could have chosen any of the observation decks in NYC but it had to be the Empire State Building. The nostalgia, the grandeur, the art deco, everything was amazing. The museum was fantastic and informative. The views were beautiful! A+++",5.0,4.946
1042,New york at its’ finest,"A friend and I visited the new observatory, and loved it. Nice job displaying the history, and wonderful views. But the highlight was going to the 102nd floor, and meeting Renita, the single employee there. My friend was afraid of heights, and Renata managed to calm her down somewhat, and it enabled us to get a photo. Then she proceeded to manage everything else going on, including a few other people with fear of heights. She is a superb representative for rhe Emoire State building!",5.0,4.9256
1043,VIP 90-min Tour Pros/Cons,"I was a little disappointed in my overall experience of the 90-minute VIP tour.

The check in location was difficult to find. My husband and I ask three different employees for assistance finding our check in location, and we still were unable to successfully locate it. Our tour guide (Gerard) was well-informed and kind. We enjoyed the history he shared on the building’s construction and changes in ownership. The VIP tour allowed us to skip the lines which was great; however, the tour allowed for little integration of the other exhibits. We were told we could go back and view them at the conclusion of our tour but were not instructed on how to find our way back to them. The views from the 86th and 102nd floors were amazing! We were able to get some great photos and Gerard shared a lot about the different buildings and landmarks visible from the Empire State Building.

The VIP tour included a souvenir picture and because my husband and I both went we received two. One of our pictures was very distorted and because they were handed to us at the end of our tour we had no chance to ask for a better picture. Furthermore, the Empire State Building tote the pictures came in left a black residue on my hands and clothes. I did not realize this at first and packed the bag in my suitcase. The black residue got on a number of my clothes, and I had to use stain remover and wash them multiple times to get the black residue out.

Overall, I did not feel like the 90-min VIP tour was worth the cost of the tickets ($175/person before taxes and fees). If I visited the Empire State Building again, I would not buy a ticket to this tour. I would instead buy a general admission ticket with skip the line add-on.",3.0,4.98
1044,Shut!,"Along with many, many other people I rolled up to this attraction at the advertised opening time. It was shut! At short notice (ie no notice) it was closed till afternoon - despite website saying it was open. Waste of time. Went to ‘The Roc’ instead.",2.0,2.5994
1045,Fantastic views,"What a great experience, with it being our first visit. No problems going in, ran smoothly. Staff helpful with getting everyone through.
Views from each floors. Inside there was plenty of windows capturing each view around the building.
When outside of course very cold we came March. Stayed up there till it turned dark. Wow when the lights go on around New York that's just another site altogether.",5.0,4.5565999999999995

1047,Finally got here,"I’ve visited NY several times and never got here for whatever reason. I decided to treat myself to four day break, see a show and visit the Empire State.
It was a beautiful day and the 86th floor viewing was fantastic!
It was everything I hoped for.
Only negative, I had a 2.30 ticket and it was really busy, so more time queuing than I wanted. That said, if you were in a group or with kids there’s loads of stuff to keep you occupied on the way up.
If you get the chance go!",4.0,4.786
1048,Good for the most part,"It was well organized, clear on how to get to the the 80th and 86th floors, but a confused mess if you paid for and want to get to the 102nd.",4.0,1.9466

1050,I have a good time with the VIP tour.,"The VIP tour manager was very kind and it was fun and useful because he told me a lot of things I would not have known if I had just come.

I took a lot of pictures at good spots and was able to have a pleasant travel time.

I would like to visit again someday next time. Thank you.",5.0,4.9508

1052,An immersive and well-thought out experience!,"I haven’t been to the ESB in close to 20 years and I don’t recall it being nearly as awesome of an experience. It is no longer just a series of lines leading up to an observatory, but rather an immersive series of presentations, staffed by 1930s-era dressed staff who were extraordinarily courteous and friendly. I would not be surprised if Disney consulted on this carefully cultivated experience. Though I initially balked at the price, my family of four had a great time and I left feeling like it was a great value.",5.0,4.9698
1053,Breathtaking Experience,"Going to the empire state building, especially during night time, was an experience I will never forget! Whether you visit it with your friends, a date, or your family, the views and pure bliss of being that high above the city will make the experience so memorable. One of my favorite parts of visiting NYC for sure!",5.0,4.8478

Would have liked to see a more focused story about the race between the Chrysler and Empire buildings trying to be the tallest and the engineering behind the Empire building hiding the spire. It may have been there and I missed it.",5.0,4.614
1056,Amazing Views,"We visited on 3/13/2022. All staff were very nice. The female employee that was working on the 102nd floor at around 2pm wanted to make sure we had the best picture and she took some for us. They were great. She was a very nice woman. and deserves recognition. The museum was very interesting.
It was a little pricey. Approximately $80 per person but its a once in a lifetime experience.",5.0,4.7434

1059,NYC visit,"The top was overwhelming. Didn't realize a structure almost 100 years old could be so technologically advanced. Next time my wife and I visit NYC we are going to bring some of the grandkids. We went to several places, Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island, The MET, and Times Square. Also China Town. We were very impressed with NYC!",5.0,4.7594
1060,Worth every moment and every penny,Absolutely wonderful! A lot of thought was put into this whole tour and the staff were exceptional!

ticketing process was fairly easy, but was not clear where we needed to present our tix, and signage was lacking.
We got luck and had great views the day we were there w clear weather. Tickets were too pricey (even for NYC prices) for what in essence was an elevator ride and a very simple museum w a couple nice static exhibits.",4.0,4.8966

1065,A bit pricy but stunning view!,"The view was stunning! If you are looking for a one-of-the-kind experience to make memories with friends or family, this is certainly the attraction. The view of NYC is incredible, especially at sunset and night. However, the tickets are a bit out of my budget as a college student. A ticket price of closer to $20-30 would be more within my budget for something I'll only experience for a few moments. My group paid over $54 per person, so be sure to make the experience worthwhile!",4.0,4.8797999999999995

1069,Family with young adults loved it!,"We loved the history and outside viewing. We took our two college-age sons and enjoyed the experience overall.

1074,Highlight of our trip,"We booked online as we weren’t 100% sure how the system worked with time slots. We’d seen some awful queues outside the Natural History Museum, so arrived really early! Luckily the staff were flexible and let us go in. There was almost no queue and it seemed quite efficient.

The staff all looked very smart in their uniforms, which elevated the feeling of luxury and importance of the building. The museum part was really interesting and we enjoyed the interactive nature of it.

We loved the 80th floor and took most of our photos here. It was warm and you can get quite close to the glass! I’d recommend doing your photos there, and then heading up to the 86th to just focus on the experience. It was freezing up there in the February wind, so the inside section was very welcome. The views are truly incredible and we made use of the Wi-Fi to FaceTime our parents from the top of the Empire State Building!

The gift shop is surprisingly reasonably priced, and we bought a couple of bits. Our trip was one of the highlights of our holiday and we had a great time.",5.0,4.9858
1075,A must see,It's a great place to visit. It's touristy but at the same time pretty cool to see everything from the top of the world. I would recommend going at the start of the day and you'll be able to get to the top with no waiting.,5.0,4.856
1076,Amazing View,The ticket is expensive but we did pay extra to go to the 102nd floor and in my opinion it is worth it. Amazing experience to be able to tour and enjoy the view off of one of the most famous buildings in the world. We got lucky that it was a super clear day and then a snow squall came in and we got to see the unobstructed view and watch the storm come in. The view of NYC and the surrounding area is jaw dropping and worth the price of admission.,5.0,4.96

1079,Awesome View - Expensive Ticket,"Okay - so I would rate the overall experience as a 4 -- and higher than that if you haven't had the experience of seeing the NYC skyline from 'way up' ... it's beautiful. Is it worth the price -- don't think so but this is NYC and if you're visiting the city I would put this on my to-do list.

I was there mid-winter and no queue at all -- but I can imagine it would be crazy crowded in peak season which is why they have so many 'waiting' areas set up as you approach the elevators.

The museum-type displays are really interesting.",3.0,3.6968
1080,Perfectly clear day….,We booked a standard ticket online & then bought tickets to go up to the top floor…. Fantastic views but then we had clear blue skies …. It was cold & blowy… but fabulous up their! Polite knowledgeable staff. Well organised…. Definitely recommend a visit !,5.0,4.9342
1081,Quite Brilliant,"It was very quiet when we visited so there were no queues and we were essentially alone which was amazing, but I can only imagine how long the queues must be at peak tourist.

They take your photo at the entrance and you can buy it later imposed onto various backgrounds. There are plenty of exhibits to take you mind off of the long queue, but we whipped past these and headed up to the 80th floor.

The windows gave a great view and there were many along with interactive old-fashioned binoculars that gave views of Coney Island, Central Park etc.

Take the lift up to the 86th floor and spend the majority of the time in the open air enjoying the panoramic views. It is amazing. We had blue skies and could see EVERYTHING. There are heaters up there for the cold weather and also indoor viewing. So cool.

IMHO no need to pay the premium to go the 102nd floor which is behind glass anyway.",5.0,4.8995999999999995
1082,"a landmark to visit, with new interactive museum floor","a very nice experience, the floor where the building of the ESB is depicted is excellent, it gives a lot of good stories and there are those movies projected on the walls which make you feel like you are part of the construction crew , up in the open!

1085,A special day at the Empire State Building!!,"Gerard Holguin was our VIP Ambassador for our tour. For two hours plus, the three of us learned so much about the history of the building, architecture, politics, restoration and the neighborhood around it. His long career and pride made this a very intimate and thoughtful adventure. He was familiar with some of the famous people who also visited the ESB. Nice start with champagne and snacks, and a gift bag at the end. Everyone working in the building knew and respected him and we were able to see some extra things! We didn’t have to wait to see anything and got priority on the elevators. It is a bit pricey but it was a tour of a life time. Unforgettable. We highly recommend this tour with Gerald!!!",5.0,4.8894
1086,Worth it!,"We chose to visit during sunset so the ticket cost was a bit higher, but worth it. Having lived nearby for years, we never thought this was something we wanted to do. We were wrong. It is definitely worth a visit.",5.0,3.9534000000000002

You save all the professionals for they higher floors.
You should be ashamed - customer service training is desperately needed. Even the tsa at the airport are nicer!",1.0,2.6948
1088,A Magical Experience on the 86th Floor!,"Our visit to the ESB was absolutely fantastic, we all loved it! Really easy to get through security etc. as we had pre-booked and we were pleasantly surprised to discover that there's a great exhibition at the start that tells you all about the history and the building of the Empire State. It was a great starting point and also told you all about movies and films that have featured the building, and there's even a cool King Kong photo opportunity! You go through all of this before you even head up; you take two elevators up to floor 86 and come out into an interior viewing area but can then head outside to walk around. The view was so magical and absolutely beautiful! We went at night as well which I think made it extra special. They have heat lamps outside too to keep you warm. This was one of the best experiences we had during our visit to NYC, can highly recommend!",5.0,4.9824
1089,Adventurous Evening with kids,"We enjoyed taking our 4 kids (ages between 3 and 13) and the view along with the exhibits and the ability to walk around, meaning not feeling over crowded in tiny spaces. It was an adventure for their wandering minds. The elevator with the digital screen was so cool! My husband was very impressed with that the most.",5.0,4.8436

1092,On Top of the World,Hadn't been to the ESP in years and I have to say I LOVED every minute of my time there. I love how there is now an exhibit to show the full history of the building.

1094,Average,Visited with my husband whilst in NYC. View is more obstructed with large railings compared to other viewpoints we’ve been too. An extra $33 dollars to go to the top- very pricey. Majority of staff were lovely and helpful. The lady shall we refer to her as at the picture desk was very rude and very clearly speaking derogatory about customers in her native language. Good covid control measures in place.,3.0,4.75
1095,Amazing day,"Me and my girlfriend came to the ESB on the 5th of Feb, Sharon B made our visit so welcoming and entertaining, she is a great asset and gives you all the information you need whilst being professional and courteous too.

The day we booked for was very cloudy and she said we could still go up if we wanted to but there would be minimal views and offered us to move our booking if needed, that was so helpful to even know we could move it and not be wasted, she even showed us how to move the booking over on the machines - so helpful.

Will definitely be recommending the Empire State Tour",5.0,4.9602

1099,NO REFUND OF TICKETS,We had travelled from Australia to New York and had travelled to the Empire State Building only to get to the top and discover it was a foggy day wth no visibility - we didn’t see anything due to the weather and was very very disappointed with the experience - no staff member told us about it - if they did we would have arranged for the experience on a different day - however we asked for a refund via email and got no response nor did we get a refund - again very very disappointed.,1.0,1.1226
1100,"Awesome Experience, loved it.","We planned to go just at the end of daylight, so we could see NY in the day and night. It was perfect and one off my wife and my bucket lists. Excellent staff, helpful, happy. Guy on the desk from Costa Rica was great, we chatted about how many footballers his country had in the UK over the years. He was funny and a clearly enjoys his job.
We absolutely loved this experience and will cherish it for years to come. Thank you.",5.0,4.9768
1101,Beware of closing time...,"When you buy tickets for the last time slot of the night (8:00-8:15 in our case), make sure you arrive by 815, as they will lock the doors on you, even at 8:16! No refunds as per site, but luckily I used PayPal and got my refund! We would have really liked to visit, but Uber driver let us out at the exit (5th Ave) not the entrance (W 34th St).",3.0,4.7626
1102,Empire state building visit,"excellent- online ticket ordering was very effficient; I made a mistake and selected the wrong date, and contacted customer service and they changed the date of my tickets for me in 24 hours; very grateful for the customer service support they provided",5.0,4.2064
1103,Surreal,There are a lot of options today of seeing NYC from the top but ESB is still classic. Felt surreal to be up there for the first time when you just saw this building in movies. Their system was very orderly. They even let guests reschedule if there is no view at the top due to bad weather. We only booked the main deck at the 86F. 4 stars because we think it is a bit expensive,4.0,1.572
1104,"Wonderful experience, but not friendly staff","The experience itself is fantastic, great views across the city when at the top and interesting facts as you walk through. The only problem we had, we chose an evening admission, 8pm, last admission was 8.15pm, we thought this was plenty of time to walk through the exhibit parts before heading to the top (we appreciate people working want to get home) however we were watching one of the film exhibits about what films have had the building included in them and a cleaner in the exhibit area told us to hurry and move on up to the top we don't hang around to read the facts. This we felt was quite rude and it made our visit feel rushed and hurried. We did get to see the wonderful views at the top, but my advice is either go earlier with the big queues, or risk a later visit and be rushed out.",3.0,4.4942
1105,Interesting and weirdly empty,"Interesting and weirdly empty, we booked the small group VIP tour but we were the only ones on the tour, our guide said it was here first tour since new years eve, this was the 12th January
Its an interesting building and the history of where it was locaked and how it was built was a very interesting part of the tour, the highlight was being 102 floors up",5.0,4.8224
1106,Over priced,"Don't waste your money on an express ticket.. when you turn up express means nothing, there are no express lines, it's quite un organised and to be honest the queues are not that bad.. over priced for what it is. But j suppose something you have do d at least once while visiting NYC.",4.0,4.008
1107,great interactive and fun displays before even getting to the view,"It was very quiet when we went last week. The displays are excellent and very informative, There are also some fun interactive displays. The views are of course amazing and nice that you are a bit lower than some of the other buildings making it a bit more adventurous. I also like that they have kept the Art Deco vibe going - in keeping with the building.",5.0,4.9012
1108,Everybody should experienced this,"Empire State Building is one of the iconic buildings of Manhattan. It has an amazing view. Wandering among the gigantic skyscrapers of Manhattan, it reminds us how small a place one occupies in this world. This building gives different feeling. Also when I looked to city, I was listening Alicia Keys - Empire State of Mind Part 2",5.0,4.2972

1110,View from Empire State Building,We thoroughly enjoyed our time at the Empire State Building. The views from the 86th floor were amazing! The signage was a little confusing on the 80th floor about how to get to the 86th floor but one of the attendants there was extremely helpful. The only suggestion we have would be to add to the 80th floor a chance to upgrade to the 102nd if you want to do so at that time.,5.0,4.7902000000000005
1111,Never fails to satisfy,I’ve visited the Empire State Building over 15 times but it never fails to astonish me how this iconic structure was built in the first place.

1114,Iconic,We visited 3 Observatory while in NYC - This was 2nd best i found and gives you such a different view to One World Observatory. The Empire state building gives you more a classy old school feel with fantastically friendly staff and a good museum. Must defo good iconic spot to visit,5.0,4.8936
1115,World Iconic Site,You just have to visit one of the Worlds most iconic building...not the cheapest tour in NYC...three adults to the very top glass level was around the 200 dollar mark but on reflection it was worth the price. From the very start you are met by staff wearing old fashioned uniforms from the era and when you go up the different levels you get a real sense of how the building was constructed and how the guys built it you can almost feel them red hot rivets being thrown past you...!!!! lots of interaction stages and great photos..pay for the very top level 102 were the staff were so helpful in taking group photos with a real twist that producers excellent photos..!!!!,5.0,4.9518

I’d recommend this visit to everyone.",5.0,4.9188

1122,Go just before sunset,"We went up to the viewing area about an hour before sunset. We got fabulous views and then as the sun set, the lights of Manhattan started to come on. When it was totally dark it changed again and again. Well worth a visit.",5.0,4.5012
1123,THE EXPRESS TICKET IS A SCAM,"I visited the ESB last 5th december 21 with express tickets to the 102nd floor (confirmation number: 20211115-20754780).
Unfortunately, that day they decided to close the 102nd floor, and we couldn't go up.
When I asked for my money to be refunded for not being able to go up to the 102nd floor, at the box office they told me that I should order it online. I asked for it and have been waiting for my money back ever since.
It's not worth paying to go up to the 102nd floor, if they can close it whenever you want.
It is a scam!",1.0,1.4902

1125,Unforgettable experience!,"We booked the VIP guided tour and were met by the guide, a lovely lady by the name of Renita Edmond. We were the only two people on the tour so felt very lucky to have Renita all to ourselves. She really knows her stuff having worked at the Empire State for more than 20 years or more. We were particularly pleased with Renita's style - she made us very welcome and was so friendly we felt like we made a real friend! She explained the history of the building and was more than happy to take photos for us as we walked around. As our visit was in December we got lovely pictures of the Christmas Tree and decorations. We had one minor hiccup when the lift broke down when we were on the 102nd floor but Renita showed her professionalism by taking charge of the situation and ensuring other customers remained calm. We had to walk down the stairs to the 86th floor to get the lift down to the ground and Renita gave us complimentary tickets to visit again as compensation for the inconvenience although we saw it as an added bonus to the tour. We would thoroughly recommend the tour to anyone visiting the Big Apple and would especially recommend Renita as your guide. Thanks for a great time Renita!",5.0,4.9864

1127,Iconic Tourist Attraction in NYC,"The Empire State Building is exactly what you would expect in large part. A lot of semi-corny interactive bits with a lot of spectacular views. The overall price is probably a bit extravagant but it is one of those places you usually want to see when you are in town. There are a number of interactive exhibits to engage kids and people who have to stand in line, although the lines are down a lot while COVID is going on. That being said, standing at the threshold and looking out over the city is an amazing experience.",4.0,4.7614

1129,Much more than I remember,"I visited the Empire State Building as a child, and remember the incredible height and view. Returning now, decades later, the experience is so much richer. The creative use of video showed me that the building is more than a place to look from. It is a place to be in. It has a fascinating history and movie stardom (King Kong, of course). The lead up to the 80th floor, then the 86th, then the 102nd was staged so dramatically that it rivaled the feeling of having New York City at my feet.",5.0,4.781
1130,"Nice views across Manhattan etc, not much else of note","After 6 years of visiting NYC for leisure and business I had never been ""up the Empire State Building,"" so when my wife and son joined me on a recent business trip they insisted we go..... for what it cost, it was not much of an experience, but then maybe my expectations were a little high",3.0,3.0
1131,Iconic building around the future,Wow you can't beat an iconic building. It's not just about going to the top but the experiance before you even get to the lift.o visited 30 years ago it hasn't changed at the top.

1133,Great 360* views of Manhattan,"Book tickets in advance - takes 10-15 minutes to get from security up to the 86th floor. Views from 86th floor are fantastic, not sure if it is worth purchasing the more expensive ticket to go up to the 102nd floor. Plenty of areas to take photos outside. Check weather forecast before going - if it's overcast/cloudy, visibility is not great and you won't be able to see views of Manhattan.",5.0,3.7814
1134,Was ruined,"The building was clean, and was a good day, with good views, however my day was ruined by very rude staff as me and my finacée entered and exited the elevator. Spoke to other guests with attitude and I was dissatisfied with the service of such an iconic building",2.0,2.7474

However be prepared as the staff are so rude! From the lady at the ticket office to the security staff inside they were awful - so disinterested, condescending and out right rude. Not what I’d expect given the amount it costs to visit. We visited twice as the first time it was cloudy so had to change our tickets and both times we experienced the same from the staff.",3.0,3.8272
1139,Good experience,"The overall experience was pretty good. It wasn't too packed with people, maybe because it was late November. The King Kong interactive experience was interesting on the way up and the interactive experience in the elevator showing the building of the empire state building was informative as was the floor with a look on its history. The views were fantastic",4.0,4.8162
1140,"Great visit to the ESB, super interesting, great views","Family and I were looking at the many observation tower spots in NYC over the holidays. Given COVID restraints and changing landscape for the pandemic, we were not planning activities too far ahead. There are many observation towers in Manhattan now -- 30 rock, The Edge, One Vandy, etc. Each tries to outdo the next with bells and whistles while you wait in line or to give you unique viewpoints. Nothing wrong with that, but we found that all of them were booked days in advance, and had lines out the door onto the street (in the case of 30 Rock and One Vanderbilt anyway).

So, we took a same day chance on the Empire State Building. First, we got tickets same day. No waiting outside. No line inside. 2 minute wait for an elevator. The history of the building is amazing. It's a beautiful building, and the back story of when it was built, how it was financed, the engineering and process was super interesting, and not overwhelming for the kids. The staff was great and kept things moving. Finally, the views were great, it was not too crowded at all, people were friendly, and the heat lamps for the outside portion of the observation tower were a nice touch on a cold day. Great views, great experience. Would not hesitate to recommend. Save yourself some time and hit the classic Empire State Building for your Manhattan views.",5.0,4.9918

The only thing that I was disappointed in was we wanted to take a picture with the two story replica of the building that is inside but we were pushed past it and you don’t get to go back to that spot at the end. So we never got to take our picture there. All the workers were very nice.,5.0,4.4976

It was spectacular to see on New Years Eve, however we were thoroughly disappointed to find out that it closed at 11pm. We had hoped to see the New Years fireworks come midnight and to experience a passionate kiss on one of the world's wonders.

Still a great place either to visit alone, or with company!",5.0,4.8744
1145,"Staff is rude, hostile and aggressive.","This was my second visit to Empire State Building and it was so different than the first time. Maybe it was because it was December 31st and the staff was tired… yelling to people to get on the elevator, Dividing group families with children into different elevators and yelling if somebody did not obey them. Felt like I was in an army training and had to answer “Sir, yes sir”. You should give them some serious customer service training after all as A PAYING CUSTOMER, MY TICKET PAYS FOR THE STAFF SALARY, they should be at least polite!!!",1.0,4.3962

It’s an amazing place walking around the 80th floor which is inside with lots to see and do. You then go on another lift to go outside which is heated and really warm.

Pandemic changes beyond our control impacted our plans, but the tickets are non refundable so we had to be flexible in order to still make the visit. When we got there, it was all fogged out and were encouraged to exchange our ticket for another day. Since it was our only time to see it, we proceeded.

She was so helpful and passionate to give us the best shots for our lifelong memory. 5 stars is not even enough for her actually.

On the other hand, we're not really happy with Singh - the cashier at the souvenir shop because he seemed lazy to answer our concerns on the product we bought and the Hispanic girl who works at where we paid for the photos was kinda rude.

Staff usually smiling and welcoming was late, no welcome and with a tone different. Control of bags was harder than in airports , we had to throw away items that were screened ok in JFK, Roma and Geneva airport ...nonsense....
Moving on we had to go through a number of alleys that depict Empire State Buulding as the thing to do. Like an overblown ego, this self satisfactory presentation is somehow disappointing and no historical details to feed one curiosity....
Once you reach the top, nothing really. Top of the rock offers you the iconic view on ESB, but ESB offers you a chance to pay 38$ pp to reach the upper level.,,
Disappointing.
I believe that tower OWTC south of Manhattan might offer another great view - and one of the bay too. We should have done that one instead.

1178,From Australia to the top of the world,"Coming to NYC is one of those things that should be on everyone’s bucket list and coming the the Empire State Building was the absolute highlight of our time in NYC.
We went all the way to 102nd floor and the views are something my son and I will remember forever.
Incredible view and an incredible experience.
Thank you to all the wonderful staff & we’re all happy to answer any questions and share their knowledge about the building and the city.",5.0,4.852
1179,Empire State Building,The 86 floor experience was great. Next time I will pay the extra $35 and go to floor 102. A lot of history in the building. You can take photos of the city.,5.0,3.5464
1180,Amazing bucket list idea,"Loved the museum, the views and the ambience. The staff were helpful. Clean. Safe. Great value for price",5.0,4.9142
1181,need designated lines for museum and straight to the top,"There are so many places the line can be sped up, it looks like you need to wait in certain lines because people are there, just have a direct path for people who just want to go straight to the top

Its an unbeatable view! just need to get there quicker",4.0,4.568
1182,A must see but rude staff,"Very educational and interesting, Awesome views of NYC. Loved the part when King Kong was trying to get in. A must see as it is one of the most iconic landmarks in the world!
The reason I only gave it a 3 is that the staff was really rude at times.",3.0,4.6772
1183,Too expensive,"It is an emblematic place but too expensive. You could do many other things with that money like visiting museums or travel by ferry to the Liberty Statue. I think they could have a cheaper ticket, more visitors will go and at the end they will earn the same quantity of money. Just an idea.",2.0,4.6676
1184,Stunning views!,"Amazing views is an understatement… you get a 360° view of New York City that does not disappoint.. we did the general admission for the 80th and 102nd floor… The 80th floor is all enclosed with large windows that allow you to view the city but but the main attraction is going to be at the top where you can actually exit the building and get even better, unobstructed views… they had fast passes available but honestly the line went pretty fast. I think we waited around 25 minutes but while you wait, there are large windows that allow you to see the city… A must see!",5.0,4.9492
1185,"Great views and nice exhibit prior, but expensive and staff was a bit rude","Must do in New York but with a family that's a real budget to visit...
I found the staff a bit rude specially the security when there is no need to be (I'm not supposed to know what we have to remove or not during X-Ray)",4.0,1.8562
1186,Awesome!,"For the most part a very well organized experience. Once our time slot was allowed in we moved quickly through security. Great views from the top and the heaters outside were a welcome addition! The only downside was the long line to enter. There were many people standing in line for the 11:00 time slot. We had a 10:45 time slot we were able to purchase at 10:50 and would have been stuck behind the 11:00 group had I not walked up to the front of the line to check in the status of the line we were in. Other than that, a great experience!",5.0,4.8794
1187,Pretty cool,"If you have never been to NYC, then check it out…if you have time. Otherwise, don’t spend your money on this. You can get an amazing view at Top of the Rock for less. Empire state tour is short, fast and not much to it. My wife and I finished everything in 45 min or less. Overly packed and only got a few cool shots. Staff is friendly, and New Yorky, and constantly tell people where to go. Its part of their job, can’t blame them. Just like any other toursit trap, thy try to get you to buy their photos.
If you must go to this, then check it out.",3.0,4.672
1188,An NYC must see attraction,What can I say? What a fabulous experience from start to finish. A huge thank you to Angelo who honoured express passes for my family and I from a visit a couple of years ago. First class service all the way. Amazing must see views from the top. Even the windy weather didn’t spoil any part of it. The king kong exhibition is new since our last visit which only adds to the whole amazing attraction. An NYC must see. Thank you again Angelo. You’re the best!!,5.0,4.9670000000000005
1189,Loved the day & night access,We had City Passes which allowed us to visit once in the daytime and once later that night. We loved not having to decide if we wanted to go in daylight or at night. We loved seeing both. It was a sunny day so the night view was stunning but the day view was a little hazy. Still completely worth it.,4.0,4.7104
1190,Viator/TripAdvisor Mobile Scan did not work in building- No help or refund for VIP Tix,"This was a Viator tour through Tripadvisor. When we arrived, the mobile scan did not work and our tickets were not valid. We were not able to use the VIP Guided Tour/Skip-the-Line, but the staff allowed us regular admission since we had copies of the receipt in hand.

Tripadvisor and Viator was unable to help us while we were inside the building and now will not refund the ticket even though we only were admitted regular admission after standing in line for 65 min. and not getting to use the VIP Guided Tour and Skip the line. This is very bad customer service and dishonest.

The staff at the Empire State Building were wonderful and kind despite the tickets not working and at least allowed us in for a regular visit.",1.0,4.9022
1191,Amazing,We went at night. The staff was friendly and welcoming. The inside displays were top notch. Of course the view of the city at night was absolutely amazing! The heated outside was a welcome bonus.,5.0,4.9142
1192,skip the extra taco lunch at Tacombi,"The building tour was great. I bought the add on lunch at Tacombi. ***DO NOT GET THIS LUNCH***. It should not be offered anymore.

It's only valid for a very small portion of the menu. Your only option for a drink was a margaritia (pre made in bulk). I had to pay extra for a soft drink. The tacos were insanely small and not appropriate. The ""chips and salsa"" option only included an extremely small amount of food. It really looked like a joke and they knew it.",3.0,4.6756

1197,A view worth paying for,Go for the full experience ( 86th and 102th floors). Interesting to learn about the history of the building before heading up. The views are amazing and the feeling of being at the top of the world can't be described.,5.0,4.6632
1198,Best Building,"It was amazing, at the top, you can see the entire NYC!! Any direction, plus there are even heat up there to keep us warm!!

1206,good place,pertty high bulding situated just near the sea shore. I couldnot get a chance to go up. good place to visit,4.0,4.1988
1207,On a high all day!,"Visited both the Edge and the Empire State Building on the same day. Great to see the old and the new. The Empire State Building is really impressive for its age, and better for getting an overall view of the city and the surrounding areas than the Edge. However, not for the faint-hearted in December as even on a ""still"" day"" there was a lot of buffeting on the outside viewing platform (although it was less scary than the Edge). Recommend paying the extar to go to the top - ""only"" an extra 22 floors, but a significant difference in what one could see.",4.0,4.6032

1211,Gerard is “Da Man”!,"Ya get what you pay for! This is a bit more, but you’re not treated like cattle, PLUS & a very big PLUS, you get to meet Gerard. Gerard, is the perfect example of excellence in every quality a tour guide should be. He is knowledgeable, friendly, accessible, and most very caring. I’m horrified of heights (I know, what was I thinking booking this but…), I notified Gerard of my phobia, and he made accommodations while we were touring, and guess what? Through his caring I was able to look over the edge on the 103 floor. Gerard, loves his work and it shows.",5.0,4.9454
1212,Bucket List experience,"Amazing views. booked VIP and no lines or waiting. Well run, very clean, super polite staff. Tickets were easy to purchase",5.0,4.9144000000000005
1213,Fix your Queus!,"This is an expensive actvity, but you'll forget the price once you get to the 86th floor. DO NOT PAY EXTRA FOR 102nd FLOOR, you'll get what you want on the 86th.Do however pay the extra for the sunset. Seeing the city light up before your eyes is unforgettable.They just REALLY need to fix the chaos of the queu outside. Ticket says to line up at the red carpet. There is no red carpet, just a bunch of confused people lined up or bunched up and a couple of doormen who are rude to anyone who has questions as to where to line up for a specific time. THERE ARE NO INDICATIONS, so their rudeness is totally uncalled for.",4.0,1.0522
1214,Glad we did it,"This was our second time to NYC. We had a little extra time, so decided to visit the Empire State Building. When looking at the options and not knowing how long the tour would take, we decided to opt for the VIP experience. Best decision we could have made. It felt like we could’ve been on the 86th floor within minutes if we wanted. Bypassing most lines allowed us the opportunity to check out the exhibits within our time constraint. Would definitely do it again if we were traveling with others who haven’t.",5.0,4.8908000000000005

1217,Fabulous Visit,"Amazing visit, new entrance and museum is just stunning, King King exhibit is really fun. Lines moved very quickly. My ticket allowed me to each observation area (80th, 86th, and 102nd floors), elevator is an amazing experience and then you experienced just the most amazing views",5.0,4.9116

1219,Experience of a lifetime,"We went to each observation area (80th, 86th, and 102nd floors) Exceeded every expectation I had. Some things I didn’t know/expect: The outdoor view you see in most pictures/movies is actually on the 86th floor. The 102nd floor is indoor floor to ceiling glass with a full 360 degree view. All incredible views. Also your ears pop in the elevator on the way up! It’s quite the journey from the entrance at ground level all the way up. Tons to see on the way.",5.0,3.0

1222,Couples trip to the Empire State Building,Visiting the Empire State Building was on my bucket list and it exceeded all my expectations. It’s absolutely beautiful! The line was long but it moved incredibly fast and it was all so organized so it was great how organized everything was. The only thing that was kind of a bummer was how big the price difference was to get to the highest floor versus the 86th floor.,5.0,4.453
1223,Night visit to the Empire State Building,LOVED IT! Seriously worth every penny. Day or night but we certainly loved this evening visit. It's so much more than a beautiful view.,5.0,4.9216

1226,"Fabulous views, don't miss the lifts!","Great views, interesting displays, long queues (sunny day, early December) . Just remember that the first lift only takes you part way, to what is basically a standard offie floor. You should join the queue for the next lift immediately to get to the open air platform.

Didn't like the electric heaters round the balcony - huge waste of energy and you expect it to be cold that high up.

Day of our visit a band was setting up for a video (I think) in one corner, which restricted access.",5.0,4.4174
1227,Unforgettable!,"There is always room for improvement, but the overall experience is wonderful. The “ red carpet” ticket doesn’t really “ express” you through the admission process and lines. Must try floor 102 !!",5.0,4.6482
1228,An amazing view,Everyone should upgrade their ticket to the 102nd floor... And visit at night to see New York lit up.,5.0,3.0
1229,Great view a must do,I think the ESB doesn't necessarily offer the best views of Manhattan however the experience as a whole needs to be done. A photo with the iconic metal safety barrier behind you is just as iconic as the building itself.,5.0,4.5158000000000005
1230,VIP Tour is Tops!,"The only way to really visit the ESB is with a VIP Tour. Our young grand daughters learned so much during the tour. Our guide, Siobhan, was fantastic and so enthusiastic! She knows her history of the ESB. She is an real asset for the company. Our day was clear and cool so the views were incredible. The tour was so good we’ll do it again with our grandsons next year!",5.0,4.9546
1231,90 degrees in the building,Couldn’t enjoy any of it. Sweating the entire time until we were outside for 20 minutes. So so so hot. The heat is insane. Selected 12:00 time. Didn’t get to go outside until 1:40pm. Had no idea we would have to wait in line that long to actually get outside to see the views. All that waiting in a hot building. Did not enjoy it. We would never do this again.,1.0,3.7224

The ESB is wondrous and all of the presentations and interactive areas on the way up are entertaining and educational. It’s a ‘must see’ if you’re in New York!",5.0,4.4652

1240,VIP Tour the BEST!,"We have visited the ESB many times but not like this! The VIP Tour took us many places you cannot visit just buying a ticket. Plus you get a real history lesson. Our grand daughters just loved the whole experience. We were a group of 6 plus our guide. We visited basements, vaults unmarked floors not to mention King Kong! Plus we always had access to the front of the line!
You pay more but you get SO much more for your money.",5.0,4.8766
1241,Breathtaking views and the employees are amazing!,"I am afraid of heights but I had to go to the Empire State Building it was my first time in New York. Of course my husband wanted to go to the 102nd floor and when I did I was literally amazed with the views. I didn’t want to take a picture at the windows but your employee Renita said I would be fine. She made me feel relaxed and took me our picture. I left with a smile, I had the best experience.

1245,Awesome!!!,"As a second time visitor, this time at night, the sights are even more amazing. Seeing the NYC lights at night in the Fall is totally different to seeing the city in the summer.

1253,"Overpriced, overcrowded","This is an iconic building with spectacular views end it used to be a joy to visit. The entire experience is now to commercialized with too many lines and waiting and crowds to suffer just for a few minutes of views. The cost for even basic (non-express) tickets is outlandish. The building and it’s decor is gorgeous inside, and this is definitely a must-see landmark for any NYC visit, but this is no longer a repeat-activity for my family. I’ve been multiple times in 3 decades of visits, but there are now more easily accessible, less-lengthy rooftops to visit for incredible views that we will visit & suggest to others. There is too much to see and do in NYC to waste so much time trying to get to the top of Empire.",3.0,3.877
1254,Never disappoints,"I grew up in NYC and have gone to the Empire State Building since I was a child. Every time I go, I still feel like a little kid. Except my wallet doesn't feel as lite as it used to $$$$. But the ability to walk around and get 360 of Manhattan is awesome. She's not the tallest building and it's starting to become sales trap (all the gift shops you have to walk through). It still has to remain on your to do list, even if it means skipping the other newest observation deck... The Edge... that was a waste considering how much more you see at the Empire.",5.0,4.6402

Paid for the viewing gallery on 86th floor which I thought was good value but the substantial additional amount to go to the 102nd level, over 30 dollars more seemed excessive. Clear day with blue sky meant could see for miles. Would like to do the same visit at night.",5.0,4.8208

Despite having ""timed tickets"" we waited in line outside to enter the building; inside the building at multiple points to go up to the viewing deck; AND then in more lines to come back down from the viewing deck. We spent 2+ hours in line for a few minutes of experience. The whole experience felt unsafe with so many people crowded into small spaces with limited exits, and others around us were commenting that they would NEVER go back. The building seemed unprepared for holiday visitors, and there was no warning that we would be in line the entire time of our visit (no signage, nothing on website in advance, no email with ""what to expect"", etc.) I do not recommend.",1.0,1.2816

the building is open late at night also , it might be good to see the city lit up",5.0,3.8808
1270,Fantastic,Super organized and efficient. Loved it. Great trip even for a party of nine. Beautiful and super clean,5.0,4.9632000000000005
1271,Amazing sights and offerings,The view was amazing! The inside of the building also offered a lot of interesting displays and tidbits about the building's construction and history. I also really appreciated the photo booth there.,5.0,4.7712
1272,Underwhelming,Staff was mostly friendly. Not enough guidance and we were confused. NYC prices should warrant NYC experience just didn’t meet the bar,3.0,3.4526
1273,A holiday must,"Watching the sunrise from the Empire State is something everyone should do on their visit to NYC. The views were absolutely stunning, it was quiet and peaceful and we had lots of space. On a viewing platform that normally fits hundreds there was only a handful of people. The staff were incredibly helpful and friendly and they let us view the gallery also during our visit.",5.0,4.8254
1274,View and architecture,"I grew up outside of NYC and then lived in NYC but aside from a school trip when I was very young, I had never visited. Having worked in the World Trade Center years before 9/11, I never saw the point. However, as a result of a cancelled airline flight from NYC I had several days to fill so my son and I visited. It was definitely worth it although I would only visit on a clear day and it helped that even on Labor Day weekend it was mostly empty so we could visit on the spur of the moment and there were no lines. Surprisingly the views at the 86th and 102nd are different so it is worth going all the way up if you can do so. Also, the architecture is worth seeing. Be aware that the signage to enter the building is terrible so check in advance as to what door is open.",5.0,4.2620000000000005
1275,Top of the Empire,"This is a do not miss experience in NYC. From the sweeping vistas across Manhattan to the wonderful exhibits along the way, this was a spectacular experience. The videos of the actual construction of the Empire State building were fantastic and the exhibit of Movies involving the building were fun.",5.0,4.802
1276,Visit the most iconic building in the the city!,My wife and I booked tickets for the 86 + 102 floors at sunset. It was worth every penny. The views were stunning. We found the whole operation very organized and fluid. The guides friendly and informative. The pictures we snapped are priceless.,5.0,4.2498000000000005

1278,Terrible customer service,"Terrible customer service. Attendants that shout and scream at customer, speak to them in a belittling manner even when that are in the wrong. View is great, building is great but unfortunately customer service is stuck in the year the building was built!",2.0,1.6104
1279,Empire at sunset,Awesome new experience inside the building before you enter the 86th floor outdoor observation deck. Great upgrade!,5.0,4.7176
1280,Great attraction!,We had the perfect weather for November! Clear skies and they had heaters on the observation deck! We only went to the 86th floor and were perfectly content not going to the 102nd floor. Book the sunset times to see NYC during the day and then turn into night!,5.0,4.8154
1281,Amazing,"I love what you have done to the new lifts and all the revamping inside , it looks a lot different to 2004 , my partner loved it and we both can’t wait to come back we’re from the uk ..",5.0,4.6884

1283,bucket list!!!1,Wonderful experience!!! Staff is amazing! There was a lot of different things to look at. I thought it was just an elevator ride to the top. Nope! So much more! highly recommend,5.0,4.853
1284,An unforgettable experience!,"Apart from the Covid silliness at the entrance, this an experiment well worth having!
Obviously the views from top are spectacular, and we were lucky enough to have a good, clear day, but aside from this, the level of detail that is available regarding the construction and subsequent modernisation of the building is overwhelming!
We thoroughly enjoyed our time in New York, and this was more than due to our visit to this wonderful building!",5.0,4.9216
1285,Spectacular,This was an evening visit. It was very quiet and no queues so our “skip the line” tickets were not necessary. Sights were magnificent. History interesting. Impressed by the outside heaters to keep you cosy whilst viewing.,4.0,4.6080000000000005
1286,"Definitely would recommend. If you’re in doubt, don’t be, it’s fabulous!!","Mixed advise before travelling about going up the Empire State Building, so glad I followed my own thoughts and visited the Empire State Building, it’s iconic and a must. We visited at 8.15pm and it was super quiet. We had the pleasure of extremely attentive staff and a member of staff in the lobby talking at length about his passion for the building. Lovely for such a personalised approach. The views at night were truly extraordinary and loved the walk through interactive displays.",5.0,4.9559999999999995
1287,Great Experience,"The view of the city is truly what you pay for, but I had the pleasure of meeting one of the employees who had been with the company for 23 years. She was so incredibly kind, took pictures for the guests, and made small talk to help people feel comfortable. She is one of the reasons I will go back in a heartbeat.",5.0,4.9386
1288,Great views of NYC,"Enjoyed revisiting the Empire State Building after 57 years. I was 10 years old on my first visit. I enjoyed it then, but appreciate it more as an adult, plus I am taller to see the view without someone lifting me up.",5.0,4.5628
1289,Empire State Building,"Any visit to New York should include a trip to the top of the Empire State Building.

Yes, there are now higher viewing platforms but this one is iconic and provides a magnificent 360 degree view of Manhattan and beyond.

Some things to consider because these will increase the already high price of your visit.

Consider when you will visit. We paid extra for express routing to avoid the crowds. In November this was un-necessary and the express routes to exit were even closed.

We paid extra for a sunset time. Again, consider the time of year because in November the sun is very low and if anything once setting, although cast magnificent light on buildings, made viewing very difficult.

If we were to do it again, we would consider night time to see all of Manhattan lit up. I'm sure this would give a whole new experience.

All things considered, it is to be recommended.",4.0,4.819
1290,Disappointing skip the line experience,Obviously the views were great. However we had paid for skip the line. Quite a lot of the short cuts were roped off. The staff on the street door were bordering rude. The staff inside were fine.,3.0,3.3558
1291,Sightseeing Pass sucks,"The Sightseeing Pass sucks half the attractions it features are not valid, and they continue including them in their publicity. very bad!",2.0,1.8324
1292,Outstanding Presentation and Awe Inspiring Views,"This is a must see in NYC - and not just the views. The story that's told, in so many ways - was as impressive to us as the sights from the 86th floor. Interactive, innovative and creative storytelling that was genuinely entertaining. Complementing this the staff on site were really terrific - engaging, helpful, friendly and funny.",5.0,4.9564
1293,Iconic Tourist Attraction,"This was our first time to the Empire State Building and the views did NOT disappoint. The timed tickets worked really well, and the views from the 102 floor were incredible. Although, honestly, my favorite place was the 86th floor!",5.0,4.7466
1294,Surprise Engagement,Had a fabulous visit! My boyfriend proposed out on the observatory deck on the 86th floor! All the employees were so nice and friendly! We especially liked Julius he was so sweet and congratulatory! Made us feel special. We also loved that the photography staff let us go back down and take our photo again to show off the ring! And helped us with our photo order! Thank you for a once in a lifetime memory!!,5.0,4.9624
1295,Empire state observation deck visit,Took way too long to get upstairs. Got to 80. Had to walk to 86 which wasn't terrible but was crowded on the observation deck. Never made it to 102. Too many people. The building is a marvel.,3.0,4.1372
1296,Epic views at sunset,First time visiting the Empire State Building and the views were amazing. Book during sunset hour for epic views and stunning photos.,5.0,4.5012
1297,VIP Tour was an Amazing Experience!,"This was my first time experiencing a VIP tour (and ESB tour in general) as a gift through friends and it was an amazing experience! Our tour guide Gerard H. was extremely kind and insightful. He made sure our experience was enriching but also comfortable! He paced with our group which made the experience very comfortable but made sure to also leave us with a lot of knowledge at almost every corner! Highly recommend requesting him if possible. He told us about his years of experience touring and it showed. Overall, it was a great experience as someone who grew up in the tri-state area, finally seeing the ESB (and in this way) was definitely an experience to remember! PS VIP tours also have access to the celebrity green room and free perks (along with snacks, souvenirs, and skipping the line)! 5 stars!",5.0,4.9876000000000005
1298,Great experience!,So beautiful at night. Glad we did this in the evening! You could see the entire city and the lights were spectacular. Very romantic…. we saw people getting engaged. All of the kids ages 7 - 14 loved the experience both before riding the elevator up and once we got upstairs. The observation deck was very windy. Hold on to your hats and masks! So fun.,5.0,4.9164
1299,The View,I do recommend going up to the 102nd floor. It was worth the money. Everyone was helpful and so nice.,5.0,4.7032
1300,I love it,"The experience is amazing, I felt a little expensive. I liked the fact that despite being outside there was heating in all the area. And the views are amazing.",4.0,4.757
1301,Beautiful views,"I always love the Empire State Building. Beautiful, classic building, and the views are great. We did pay (crazy) extra for the 103rd floor, but it was special and worth it.",5.0,4.8124
1302,Love new higher floor.,First time doing sunset and night viewing. They do a great job with the history and cultural context of the Empire State Building,5.0,4.2498000000000005
1303,Party of 1,"Friendly staff, cleanliness, and helpful staff to take some pictures of me instead of selfies. Completely enjoyed my visit!",5.0,4.7432
1304,Worth it!!!,Bought tickets before closing and it was pretty awesome because their was less crowds and the staff was amazing and most importantly the view of NYC was breathtaking.,5.0,4.8986
1305,Old buiding,"I've rather prefered this clasic building instead of going to the new sky scraper ones and I loved it.
Thank you.",5.0,4.5012
1306,Most Staff Were Fantastic,"Many of the staff were friendly and talkative. Some though seemed bothered if you asked questions and tried to interact beyond being pointed this way or that way. I was there on a weekday and during school so it wasn't overly crowded. The views were wonderful, just wished people were a little more kind to each other.",3.0,4.6815999999999995
1307,A great NYC experience,Really friendly employees there and great views from an iconic piece of US history. Highly recommend for anyone visiting NYC and also with families.,5.0,4.7712
1308,Enjoyable experience,Of course views on a clear day are wonderful. ESB also did a great job on educational museum on first few floors prior to the elevators.,5.0,4.772
1309,Very well organized,"I think it was a great experience. The staff was very friendly, attentive and helpful. Would definitely recommend visiting the Empire State Building if you are in NYC. We got our tickets for 4:45 pm and got to see a beautiful sunset.",5.0,4.9224
1310,A Great View and So Much More,"Seeing the Empire State Building has surely changed over the years. It's not just a trip up and then back down.

Now it is a meandering walk through thoughtful and often interactive displays chronicling the building's history. That walk eventually leads to the elevators for the various observation floors, and overall it is a terrific and educational experience, if a bit steep in price.

The one drawback is that that meandering walk also weaves you through the maze of the gift shop--the only way out.",4.0,4.777
1311,Awe-inspiring and fun,Excellent activity for old and young alike! Lots of great historical information presented in a multitude of relatable ways with just the right amount of cultural/entertainment highlights thrown in. Tweenager approved and totally worth the expenditure.,5.0,4.8398
1312,Great upgrades since last time,"I’m early November the crowds still not back at the ESB and we shared the experience with another 15-20 people.

That is of course a luxury but I just also say that the experience have been looked after and upgraded jab the last few years and I think they’ve done a great job.

Much more history and interactive features and really catering to the kids and kids inside us.

We’ll done and I’m happy to give my kid this unique memory.",5.0,4.8492
1313,Refreshed experience!,It has been 20 years since I last went up in the Empire States Building. Wow things have changed! Very unique displays and interactive exhibits. Would recommend to others to revisit this landmark!,5.0,4.6104
1314,Worth Every Penny!,"ESB was included with our pass, but we were looking for something a little more special. So, we decided to go for the upgrade and visit and dawn. That decision led to the best experience of our New York visit.

Yes, we have all climbed tall things at marveled at the sights that could be seen, but being in the clouds at dawn is something that is difficult to describe in large part because it was so unexpected. Instead of forcing you to read a lot of extra words, I’ll make a list instead:
1) The air is clear because it hasn’t had all day to absorb the pollution;
2) The city is actually quiet (as quiet as New York can be);
3) The crowd was more than 40, so now elbows needed to be shoved into ribs;
4) The service was excellent; and
5) The silhouette of ESB on the nearby clouds? Just, wow!",5.0,4.958
1315,Overrated,"I found the experience has the potential to be moving and rewarding, but that was all undercut by the sticker shock!",2.0,2.281
1316,Iconic and expensie elevator rides,"It has been forever since I'd been up the ESB, so I splurged and made the trip. First of all, it is extremely over-priced for what you get--which is a view in a famous old building. There are many other buildings you can visit that have elevators and views. I think my ticket was around $80. We arrived early for our 11 AM entry, and I highly recommend going early. We had the place to ourselves most of the time. All the corridors and barriers and hallways are somewhat confusing, but there are many staff people to direct visitors. Fortunately, the day was relatively clear, so that was a bonus. There is a sort of ""museum"" with interesting trivia about the history and construction of the building, as well as photos of celebrities who have visited. Overall, this is a rather dumb activity compared to all the culture available in the city. I don't recommend it unless you don't mind spending a lot of money for some elevator rides.",3.0,4.878
1317,Good,"inside, attractions and top was so good.
Only bad thing was, when we went for enter and buy ticket inside, a lady told us just online ticket is ok, you can not buy in here.
Another day we bought from web and enter and we saw there is also ticket sales inside.
This changed our another plans and wrong info was unproffessional",4.0,3.5598
1318,Overpriced but good experience,We were in New York for a birthday weekend and the views didn’t disappoint. It was just very expensive for a few minutes on the top of the balcony.,3.0,2.5474
1319,Awesome!!!,A must to do when visiting NY - layout was great and interactive as you make your way to the historic views - I suggest the 82nd view is worth it!!!,5.0,4.566
1320,Empire State Building,"Was in NYC for work. Decided to check out the Empire State Building (ESB). Finished up early on a Friday (10-29-2021) afternoon. I remember visiting decades ago that there were long lines and was weighing whether to buy the express (no line) upgrade. But, given there are fewer tourists and the ongoing COVID pandemic, now is the time to visit. It was not crowded and it was a breeze through the lines. I had more time to enjoy the displays leading up to the viewing area and the actual viewing area itself. In my opinion, it’s a must see for tourists and locals.",5.0,4.3806
1321,Amazing,"I visited Manhattan for the first time.
I loved every second of it.
My favorite place was The Empire state building! We visited it at night and the views are lovely!!!",5.0,4.8328

1323,Excellent displays and video footage.,The visuals depicting how the structure was built. Excellent rendition of the rivet process. How the Empire State Building developed so quickly from the ground up was amazing considering it was started in 1930.,5.0,4.6352

1325,Empire State Building experience,"We had to wait in line, despite the ticket saying otherwise. We made it to the 86th floor and the wind and rain didn’t allow for an enjoyable experience. Way overpriced for what I got.",1.0,4.1718

1327,Good site!,The Empire STate building offers wonderful views of the city. I particularly enjoyed the history and of the during building phases that were displayed on the 80th floor. Excellent attraction.,5.0,4.8648
1328,FANTASTIC First time,"This was my first trip to NYC and Ihad to tour the ESB. Bought the whole tour package and the view up there is FANTASTIC!!!!!!! The 100+ floor is worth it if you can really tolerate heights for with the glass set up to view, you can practically look down and watch your stomach hit the ground!!! The exhibits were fantastic as well. Love the KING KONG one!!! If you go, run between the two windows as KK moves about. Pretend like he is looking for you. Otherwise, all the wall videos are really well done. Will be back again.",5.0,4.9214
1329,Scam,"Complete scam. Had tickets for the nighttime viewing for 9-9:15pm. Showed up at 9:10 to see the doors locked and closed. Wouldn’t even explain to us why they closed. The man at the front desk wouldn’t even talk to us. I’ve lived by NYC my whole life and was excited to do this for the first time. Wasted $95 for nothing. Don’t respect this place one bit for doing this. Absolute scam, not going to try again.",1.0,1.2108
1330,Well worth the admission price,The exhibits are very interesting and some are just fun like seeing King Kong coming thru the window and the huge wrap around screen showing all the movies you see the Empire State building in. They have even made the elevator ride up fun. The view cannot be beat! We were able to walk right in - no waiting in line! It was wonderful! Go now before all the tourists start coming back.,5.0,4.8998
1331,Amazing!!,The Empire State Building was absolutely gorgeous!! We decided to do it at night and went all the way to the top! I couldn’t get over the views of the city! Definitely worth it,5.0,4.7940000000000005
1332,So Glad We Bought Tickets!,"Thought we were just checking the box on a must-do tourist attraction in New York, but it was much more than that. So well organized. The staff was friendly and added to the magical experience. Such an amazing site to visit - history, architectural marvel, incredible view, engaging exhibit - loved all the movie references.

1339,A breathtaking experience with beautiful views❤️,Was excited to finally go up to the observation floor. Beautiful views of the city. Only downfall is there was very poor direction on where to go when you entered the attraction and all the way through to the 86th floor.,4.0,4.4204
1340,Very well done,"The idea of spending so much for an elevator ride sounded rediculous , but they mixed the history of the building , with the movie setting wrapped up in a package produced by Walt Disney . Very cool !",5.0,4.1384
1341,Sunrise at ESB!,One of our favorite things we did in NYC. The sunrise at ESP is worth every penny. VIP treatment from the time you walk in. The people who work there were wonderful! You are there before it’s open to the public with maybe 20 other people so you don’t have people on top of you or fighting for views. Elevator up to the observation deck. Starbucks coffee with the option to purchase a pastry. The pictures you get will make you feel like a professional photographer. The views are breathtaking. Afterwards get a few minutes in the museum. This was very cool and a nice surprise. Can’t recommend enough! Only thing I would change is the gift shop isn’t open so you have to come back later in the day and go through security and all that all over again to spend money there.,5.0,4.9686
1342,extra cost worth it,sunrise at ESB was exceptional. small group observatory all to ourselves and a great sunrise to boot. a Was reluctant at the price but it turned out fine.,4.0,4.0046
1343,Don’t book through TripAdvisor,"Disaster. They had no idea we were coming. No guide, no Photo, no skipping lines, said our voucher was invalid. We will never book anything else through TripAdvisor. We booked four tours for the week and all had problems and time changes. Amateurs in almost every respect. Goodbye TripAdvisor. Deleting app now.",1.0,1.2096
1344,Easy Peasy!,"Very well organized and a pleasant experience. My companion communicated her issues of clostrophobia AND her desire to limit capacity.... all but ONE elevator operator was accomodating....and I told him so. Felt safe and welcomed. Great family outing, but be prepared for wind and tourists that may hog the spaces a little to long for that so-called-perfect selfie. One & done bucket list event. THANKS.",5.0,4.9554

Would also recommend the extra money for the 102nd floor visit as that was nice to be inside and not in the wind.",5.0,4.8402
1348,Fantastic experience made great by customer service,"This was my second trip to the ESB. I like the newer format that winds through the building rather than the old line, standing on the street. Our trip to the 102 floor was made terrific by Renita, who’s loveliness and care made the experience exponentially better. Thanks again!",5.0,4.8624
1349,Rude check-in person,"Self-guided tour is awesome. Didn't think it would be worth the money, but it was. The NYC skyline views are breath taking. However, the guy at the beginning of the outside line (I wish I knew his name) was very rude and disrespectful. He racially profiled me and my family. He asked the family in front of mine if they had tickets, and they responded yes; he never asked them for proof. When my family and I approached he asked the same thing, to which I replied yes, but he asked to see my tickets. This despite telling me to go to the kiosk to purchase tickets, AND watching me make the purchase. I should have complained once inside, but I wanted to enjoy the views instead.",4.0,4.7476
1350,Amazing experience!,I have not been to the top of Empire State building since I was in middle school. I am 50 years old now. It was the first time for the rest of our group. It was incredible. Not just the views from the top but the exhibits and fun phot ops (King Kong) on our way up too. Definitely made for an amazing start to our NYC visit.,5.0,4.8864
1351,Beautiful Building Excellent Staff,The beauty and integrity of the building has been immaculately kept but the real treasure is on the 102nd Floor and his name is Gordon. His knowledge of the building and the city and enthusiasm to share it both infectious and fascinating! Everyone should love their job as much as he does. An absolute joy and privilege to have met him. I will definitely be visiting every time I’m in town.,5.0,4.979
1352,Iconic building does not disappoint.,"I discovered during our mother/daughter trip to NYC that my 20 yo daughter was not a city girl and I had already known she had an aversion to height places, so I was surprised that she acquiesced to my spontaneous suggestion to visit the 86th floor. The observatory felt quite safe and she never once seemed uneasy. At the end of our trip, this experience was one of the things she spoke of with sincere praise.",5.0,4.7474

We grabbed the Subway near Times Square with the intent of switching trains at 34th street and heading to Central Park, but since we were right around the corner, we decided to surface and check out the Empire State Building. We are from Chicago, and have gone to the top of the Hancock and Sears (Willis) Tower. Neither compares to the experience of this tour. The touches are amazing, especially the King Kong interaction. We made a split second decision to add this experience on the street, and it became one of the highlights of a great trip. Definitely recommend.",5.0,4.9352
1362,90 years in 90 minutes,Renita Our tour guide for the VIP tour went above and beyond making our experience special. Her knowledge and history of the building was superb. Anyone looking into visiting the ESB I would highly recommend splurging on the VIP tour it is well worth it.,5.0,4.9336
1363,VIP TOUR,Well worth the money if you are interested in a “once in a lifetime” experience. Cassia was very personal and terrific. She made it special.,5.0,4.7896
1364,Great Family Activity,We went to several main tourist attractions during our weekend NYC visit but this was everyone’s favorite. The interactive exhibits downstairs and on the way up made the entire experience fun and interesting. The view from the top is especially beautiful after dark.,5.0,4.9432
1365,NYC from the Clouds,"On 10-10-2021, the employees on the first floor notified us that there was zero visibility on the observation decks and that we could choose to come back at a later date and/or time. We decided to go up anyways. It was like a hurricane up there! I have never experienced anything like it in all the times I’ve been to the Empire State Building in the past. I know my 11 year old grandson will never forgot his 1st ESB experience. We LOVED it! Just think, how many people get to stand in a cloud?",5.0,4.7622
1366,Empire State,"Amazing the view from the 102 floor, excellent organization starting with the tickets and with the stops at 80 and 86 floor",5.0,4.2972
1367,Scared of heights,"It is great to see and visit. I can't believe it's 90 years old! Seeing the history of how it was built, all the movies that building has been in. If you go, you have to go up to floor 102! Amazing views, even if I was holding in for dear life!",5.0,4.8154
1368,No line. Perfect evening.,"This was the first time we visited the ESB with no line. The entrance was smooth, workers friendly. We went at dusk, the sunset was a great time to take in the sights.",5.0,4.4538
1369,An NYC must,"Went here purely because you have to if you're in NYC for the first time. The history and story of how it was built was very interesting. The views were decent, but I prefer the ones from the Top of the Rock better.",4.0,4.5866
1370,So cool!,Went at night and there was no line to go in! We basically had the museum portion to ourselves. The view was fantastic!,5.0,3.9118
1371,A Must-Do for a Trip to Manhattan!,"I hadn't been to the time of the Empire State Building for years, but family was coming to visit the area, so I wanted to be sure they had the experience. We bought the Express Pass to both the 86th and 102nd floors, and the entire experience was fantastic! The employees were polite and personable; they really added to the overall fun! They were glad to answer questions, take pictures, or whatever they could do to add to the fun. Of course, the views were amazing! We were unlucky to have tickets for an evening after a rainy afternoon with some significant cloud cover, but we could still see many amazing views of the city and the buildings. We were on the 102nd floor at sunset, and seeing the lights of the city coming on was magical. You definitely should plan to go to the top of the ESB, including the 102nd floor, when planning a trip to NYC.",5.0,4.9830000000000005
1372,"Beautiful view, professional and friendly staff","It's always amazing to see NYC from up above. We would definitely recommend going to 86th and 102 floors. The view at 102nd floor seems so much clearer/closer to buildings, monuments, etc. Online ticketing process was easy. Highly recommend going when the building opens. There was constant traffic flow but crowd was manageable. The architecture is astounding and the building is pristine. Excellent sightseeing attractiion.",5.0,4.8946000000000005
1373,Excellent view,"I would recommend to go and see the sunset (a bit more expensive). You´ll see the city both, day and night, amazing",5.0,4.486
1374,New and improved,I loved the new viewing deck on the 102nd floor! Those big unencumbered windows are the perfect spot to get some perfect pictures! And the new museum walk through is fascinating - literally walking through the construction of this amazing building… I mean WOW! Definatly a necessary stop for anyones visit to the NYC area,5.0,4.9528
1375,Finally made it,The Empire State Building was on my bucket list of things to do and it didn't disappoint! It wasn't worth the $75 but it was worth it to say that I finally made it up to the top. The exhibits were great and the staff was exceptional.,5.0,4.6292
1376,Incredible!,"Thursday was a special day! Early afternoon we went to the Empire State Building which was amazing! We had purchased tickets online for a double whammy, the 86th and 102nd floors! We got in line outside including only 5 people in front of us. When we entered the building, there were probably 10. Now, here’s a spoiler alert! If you plan on visiting one day, I don’t want you to go any further so it won’t ruin the surprises!

Here goes! We walked a path that showed the magnificent history of the construction and milestones. There were tremendous wall-length pictures of celebrities on the observation deck, really cool! We made it to the elevators that you see in all the movies - wow! Up we go! Or, are we? It’s so smooth, it feels like we’re not even moving! Oh, and the movie on the ceiling welcoming you to the construction of each floor was a very nice touch! I mean, we had 80 floors to travel! We exited the elevator and are met with an attendant directing us to a hallway which led to a museum-like area, a neat display of signs on the ceiling providing directional signs to major landmarks in the city - love it! It’s all such a blur, but I believe this is where we got our photo taken with the city background! What a wonderful momento!. Cool stuff! We ended up on an elevator again and headed to the 86th floor observation deck. We walked outside and took some pictures; it was amazing to see the East and Hudson Rivers on either side of us merging! The Chrysler building and Freedom Tower look so small from up here!! Central Park a small patch of green - wow is all I can say! We met a nice couple from San Diego who were enjoying the experience too - I helped by taking their picture overlooking the city. Tara had done it for two friends right before that! I know they appreciated it! So, off to the next ride - the 102nd floor. We ended up at the very tip of the Empire State Building, a small observation room that was encased in windows. An outstanding 360 degree panoramic view of the city and beyond! The attendant whose son is a NY firefighter told us which direction to look for New Jersey, the mountains of Pennsylvania and much much more! Breathtaking! We saw the engineers’ access to the outside and the stairs to walk all the way down to 5th Avenue! I bet you didn’t know there were 1,869 steps from the top of the Empire State Building to the bottom! I sure am glad the elevator didn’t fail!",5.0,4.995
1377,The ultimate experience,"Loved every minute of the tour. Friendly staff, easy instructions to the top, and most of all very clean.",5.0,4.8598

1379,“Sunrise with Starbucks” WITHOUT the Starbucks?!?!,"Paid $115 ea for the “Sunrise with Starbucks” package for the 86th floor. However, only 3/4th of the people were able to get 1 medium cup of coffee before they ran out. No refills for anyone. We assumed that for $460 for 4 people it would be reasonable for us to get two cups of coffee during the 90 minutes. How expensive can two carafes of coffee be for them? Felt cheaped out on during an otherwise great experience.",2.0,3.8808

1382,Awesome experience!,He had never been to the Statue of Liberty before. The Way up to the 86 floor was very awesome we loved the props! The view from the 86 floor was awesome… The personnel were helpful and our experience was awesome I would highly recommend it!,5.0,4.9206
1383,Empire State Building Viist,The employee outside checking ID's on 10/5/21 at 8:30 PM was awfully racist towards an Asian family. He was lashing out and screaming in front of everyone rather than trying to assist in their visit. The family was struggling to communicate and he refused to let them even speak. It was heartbreaking to see that in a city like NYC there is no patience for language barriers. Will not be visiting again.,1.0,1.1454
1384,Awesome experience,First time to Empire State Building. Views were incredible and being outside enhanced the experience. Would recommend for anyone visiting New York..,5.0,3.7224
1385,No one tells you in there is low viasibility,Granted I should have not chosen a somewhat cloudy day however- they let me pay $80 for a ticket and didn't say a word about how there was ZERO visibility. They just let me take my sorry ass all the way to top to see absolutely nothing. like damn why? No refund either!,2.0,1.8396
1386,THE BEST,"All the history and stuff that is before the observatory is very cool! The view once you are at the very top is amazing, and a great way to check out the beautiful city of lights",5.0,4.904

1388,Worth the visit!,"The Empire State Building was a must-do on my first trip to NYC. I was torn between going at night or during the day, because I wanted to experience it all. I ended up go just after sunset (7:15 at the time of my October visit) and it was beautiful. Great way to end my trip! I cannot put into words how magical the city at night is - and seeing it from above was amazing. Spent near 2 hours on the 86th floor observatory absolutely amazed with the view. Recommend!!",5.0,4.9126
1389,Empire State Building Tour,"The actual tour of the Empire State Building was excellent! Most of the staff inside the building were very unfriendly and not helpful at all. No one was at the front desk to great visitors or to guide them with the admission process . In fact, if you asked a question they were down right rude and put out! I brought 3 friends to NYC for a week and this was the only site/tour that was disappointing. The taxi cab drivers were friendlier.",3.0,3.9028
1390,Beautiful I love the,Look of the city from the top it was a great experience I really loved and my girlfrend also I will do it again,5.0,4.7554
1391,Lost,"My husband and I got tickets to the 86th and 102 floors that say the time was ""7:00 - 7:15 pm and pay extra money to see the sunset. When we arrive was 6:45 they let us enter and then we felt lost, there are no signs or people that work there to guide us. We got an elevator to go to 80th floor and then an other elevator to go the 86th floor, there we told them we had tickets to go to the 102 floor then the elevator people sent us to another elevator back to 80. We asked again and the elevator person said he got confused and this time he lead us to the correct elevator. By the time we arrived to the 102th floor was already night time. NO SUNSET ANUMORE! VERY DISSAPOINTING!!!!",3.0,1.2332
1392,Worth Every Penny!,This tour was worth it! So enjoyable and fantastic views. Felt safe despite Covid. Staff was very friendly. We went before sunset and stayed to watch it. Beautiful city and beautiful historic building! Thank you!,5.0,4.9576
1393,Highlight of our day,"Though we live only an hour away in NJ, we don’t get into the city too often. I took my two sons (ages 6 & 10) in last weekend and we bounced all around, no set plans or sights to see, we were ‘winging it’. We decided to check out the Empire State Building because I think every kid should and they loved it! There were so many cool things to see and experience inside before making our way to the observation deck (much cooler than when I first visited when I was 5 years old). The views are spectacular and to see and feel that big city excitement and awe through my children’s eyes was a cool experience for me as well. Until next time…",5.0,4.818
1394,"Great time and overall experience, a bit expensive","We came at night, had a really great time and it's not only the views from the top.
There is a whole ""museum"" like experience at the beginning of the attraction.
The views at night are beautiful.
it's a bit expensive at around 85 USD per couple...
Also there were no lines at all, guess due to covid and off season",4.0,4.849

Amazing views outside on 86th floor and inside 102nd floor!",5.0,4.7234
1396,Great day out,"Perfect clear day so views were spectacular, has been 15 years since I last went up so much had changes especially the museum side. The video walls and King Kong exhibit were nice additions. Once up on 80 and 86 views were fantastic though a little knee wobbling. Recommend going on a clear day for optimum views",5.0,4.8634
1397,Fantastic Exhibit,"The history of the building, including how it was built are wonderfully displayed in the exhibits. The use of computer animation is astounding. Our guide, Hugo, took us on a VIP tour. His knowledge of the building and continually showing us interesting things was phenomenal.",5.0,4.8502
1398,Top of the world!,Trip to the top was incredible. We had a clear view and could see forever. Staff were courteous. It was interesting to see the same views from the three different floors.,5.0,4.711
1399,Great Experience,"It’s been about 30 years since I was a kid since I last visited and was very impressed by the interactive exhibits, museum-like tour, friendly staff, and of course the 86th Floor outside observatory. Would recommend to anyone visiting NYC and locals alike.",5.0,4.6878
1400,AMAZING VIEW,"It is such a beautiful place from the moment you enter the building. You are able to see some of the history behind the making of this wonderful building. In addition you get to have a picture taken with the one and only Gorilla who would make sure to pose for the picture under attack!. The 86th floor has amazing view of the city. I recommend going at night that way you see the city of lights in it’s moment and the nice cold breeze. 100% recommend, definitely going back!",5.0,4.9526
1401,Best view in town,"Amazing views, however, the building hasn’t quite recovered from COVID, so the express pass wasn’t quite needed. Unforgettable views and great gift shop.",5.0,4.7914
1402,102nd floor,"Ordered tickets on line, easy enough. Showed up 1/2 hour early and got in line. The guide was very helpful and seemed to enjoy the work. Make sure you have your Vax card and worthless mask or you cant go in. We took the ride to the 102nd observation deck. It is very small with an amazing view, Empire Greg knows about everything in NY and is a great host. We would recommend it to all. Tell Greg Hi!",5.0,4.92
1403,Great views!,Staff was so friendly. Everything was so organized. My husband and I were able to take some great photos. I loved my experience.,5.0,4.8408
1404,Empire State Building vs TOTR?,"Does New York have a more iconic building? (The answer is no). If you’re debating between visiting the Empire State Building or Top of the Rock, (my husband and I did both) my recommendation would be Empire State Building all the way. Yes, you’ll still have spectacular views of NYC from what feels like the top of the world, and yes, you’re pictures wont’t have the iconic Empire State Building (being that you’re standing on it), but this experience just can’t be beat! Way more interactive displays and history to walk through inside the building compared to TOTR. The decor is kept to that Art Deco style that almost transports you back in time. I’ll definitely remember my time on top of the Empire State Building much more than TOTR. Going up to the observation decks isn’t cheap. So if you’re deciding between the two I hope this helps.",5.0,4.9184
1405,Amazing piece of history,We purchased the tickets for both the 86th and 102nd floor observatories. Went just before sunset and watched the city change from day to night. It was very pretty and worth the cost. The story of the building is very interesting as the entire thing was built in just 13 months. It is quite beautiful and an impressive feat.,5.0,4.8892
1406,Definitely recommend,Empire State observatory Iconic place to visit excellent view New York night lights is. Back Much more,5.0,4.1438
1407,Fantastic visit!,Visiting ESB was the best thing during my visit in NYC! Such breathtaking views! And the way they showed the construction process!,5.0,4.6866
1408,Time consuming,"We paid extra for the express line, only to find out that it wasn’t available/open when we arrived, so we were blended in with everyone else. Big waste of money. Also, it took forever to finally get to the observation area, as they have you navigate security checkpoints, multiple elevators, serpentine lines, exhibits, etc. Once you’re up there it’s great. Also, the route down forces you through a large gift shop.",3.0,4.53
1409,Bucket list,"Great experience! Had no problem entering the building, clean and plenty of building employees to help. Only issue was the rain.",5.0,4.4176
1410,Worth it if you are using an NYC pass,"Classic tourist attraction. There are quite a number of other vantage points in NYC to choose from. The Empire State Building is bundled with some information on the tower's construction and some interactive elements. The NYC pass gets you do the 80-something floor, but not the highest--that is extra. You still get to see the area outside with the binoculars and definitely a good view of NYC in all directions. It is cold and windy by this time of year, so dress accordingly.",3.0,4.7312

We know There are a lot of observatories here in NY. But nothing like the Empire State.
THANK YOU ONCE AGAIN",5.0,4.8954
1419,A day to remember,This was the first stop in a whole day planned for my proposal to my future wife and it was a amazing first stop. Just being able to see every part of the city that high up and then looking down and what looked like play cars in the streets was a site I wont soon forget. Even though I probably wont be back any time soon it was worth the experience.,5.0,4.5648
1420,A Memorable September Night,"We booked online, easily found our way through--it was not crowded despite being a sunset timed visit on a Wednesday. It was windy, cool, and spectacular on the 86th floor and beyond words on the 102nd floor.

It was a wonderful experience from start to finish.",5.0,4.9166

1425,A must do when you visit NYC,Was really worth the time and money to go into the building and up to the 86th floor. This is a must do when visiting NYC.

1430,Quite the experience,It was awesome riding up to the 102 floor. I have to say that I did think it was a bit overpriced for what you got. Some of the docents were more knowledgeable than others and they should get their story straight on the cost of the penthouses you can see. Otherwise it was worth the experience. Glad we did it.,4.0,4.744
1431,Checked off of my list,"We’ve been to NYC 5 times now and had never been up the Empire State. This was the right time to go, with our friends from ÇA.

Go at sunset, but get there early so you don’t miss it !",5.0,2.725
1432,102 or Bust,"Iconic site if you go to NYC. Interior displays are very well done. Take your time and read about the amazing story of this building.

We were lucky enough to have a bright sunny day with some clouds that offered an amazing 360 view of NY city!
You can purchase tickets for the 102 floor as well but we opted for the 86th floor only due to price and the view. 86 floors allows you a high vantage point and you can still see details below. Whatever floor you chose, you will love it... take your time and enjoy the view from all sides!",5.0,4.8704

1436,Current Museum Focused on Culture over Building,"I visited the Empire State Building many years ago, around the time of the major energy efficiency retrofit, and the museum portion of the tour was at least 1/2 about the building and it’s construction. Today, that’s relegated to a single wall with limited (unexplained) construction documents, a time lapse video, and a 360 immersion experience of construction that’s sanitized to the point they may as well have had singing mice doing the work.

The rest is the buildings role in pop culture. Which, if you to take a picture with king Kong’s hands, is great, but it wasn’t what I wal looking to share with my kid.

The view from the 86th floor is still lovely, and the marble work in the elevators is fantastic, and upon exiting there’s a great view of the original Art Deco stone.",4.0,4.9614

1441,Well worth the money!,"I have been to the Empire State Building about 20 years ago. It was a ho-hum experience. This time, I was thoroughly impressed! The tour through history as you make your way up to the 80th and 86th floors was fun and captivating enough for even my 13 year old to stay interested! The views are impressive and it was awe inspiring to be able to see One World Trade Center lit up with its 9-11 memorial lights. Definitely was a highlight of our trip. One word of caution: proof of COVID vaccination was required, although this was not made clear when we booked out tickets on line. Luckily our family had the needed paperwork, but make sure you have this if you are planning a visit.",5.0,4.8622

1444,wonderful experience,"We enjoyed our tour immensely- all the staff were very friendly, helpful and seemed to love working at the Empire State Building.I will be recommending this tour to all my traveling friends",5.0,4.9058
1445,Best view in New York at Sunset,"Lots of interesting history and exhibits so plan some extra time. You can buy skip the line tickets or get a tour, but I wanted the full experience at my own pace. The 86th floor is amazing with open air views and free binoculars mounted to the floor. The 80th floor has some great views as well, but it's through glass. I went at sunset and the pictures of the skyline at dusk are incredible. If you show up a little before sunset, you can get daytime pictures and then stay a little later to get nighttime pictures as well. Don't pay for the 102nd floor; it's a rip off and only through glass. Make sure you have your vaccination card because the museum counts as an indoor location.",5.0,4.959
1446,Good Stuff,"I saw a fleet of military helicopters do the Flying V over midtown while I was up there.

Bob almost positive it was Bullwinkle but it could of been Emilio Estevez.

One or the other.",5.0,3.5708
1447,Empire,"It was great to learn about the history of the empire, getting to the observatory elevator was fun looking at all the neat things. The views from the 86-102 were just beautiful",5.0,4.872
1448,Unforgettable Views of NYC,"Fantastic way to get an aerial view of NYC. Got to the 86th floor outdoor observation deck to get a full panoramic view of the city. Would highly recommend going at night to see the city lit up. When we went the line moved very quickly and there was almost no waiting involved at all.

Like others have said, getting to see the history of how this iconic building was created added a lot to the experience and made you appreciate the building even more. **MAKE SURE YOU HAVE YOUR VACCINATION CARD** They were adamant about not letting anyone in without first checking your vaccine card and ID. The whole experience is highly worth the admission price.",5.0,4.89
1449,Loved it!,"We had a wonderful experience at the ESB, very well organized and clean. Not only do you have an amazing 360 view of the city, but you also see the history of both the building and the city. Going up the ESB is a must imo, way better than the new buildings or at least than the Edge.",5.0,4.7584
1450,Well worth it,"With floor to ceiling graphics, special effects, and meticulously designed scenes, they made what could have been a simple walk through into an immersive experience. Much more than just an elevator to the top.",5.0,4.0846
1451,Updated and Great Experience,We visited over 10 years ago so this was a nice refresh. Empire State is celebrating its 90th anniversary. They've redone the exhibits and have several photo opps. Pleasantly surprised.,5.0,4.7896
1452,Empire State Building,"This building is spectacular!!!! My first time going all the way to the top floor.
Very interactive, educational and loads of fun for all age groups.",5.0,4.481
1453,First visit,Yes - worth it. Got the sunset time. Didn't actually see the sunset but that time of day gives you great shadows on the building for spectacular pics.,5.0,4.6762
1454,Amazing views!!,"We went on a Friday sunset tour on Sept 3rd. No lines and very small crowd. It was nice to move at our own pace without people ushering us along or bumping into us. The guys at security had too much attitude (sorry if we can't remember the full list of things you're yelling at us to remove!) but the gift shop employees were really nice. Sunset is the perfect time to go because you get the daylight, sunset and nighttime views all at once!",5.0,4.8898
1455,Great Visit,"Too expensive though. When you have to spend almost $100 for each person, it just makes it hard to visit multiple times. Great Exhibits however.",5.0,4.1438
1456,Better than the rest,"Went to several observation towers and The Empire State Building was by far the best. Best view, best buy, classy and full of history. Simply the best and not crowded like the others.",5.0,4.9234

1459,Overpriced,Amazing views beautiful building inside but I really felt like it was overpriced compared to other buildings like the One World trade Center which also has amazing views.,3.0,4.9088
1460,Amazing,I have been to the Empire State Building in years past but this time it was beyond amazing. The new updates and interactive amenities are just awesome. Great for all ages.,5.0,4.9224
1461,Awesome,Great visit to the Empire State Building. The staff was very friendly. All was well organized. We had a great time.,5.0,4.8598
1462,The 102nd floor cost isn't worth it.,"Obviously the Empire State Building is a must see/do in NYC. A few notes: the entry for viewing is off to the side of the building and not in the front where you may assume. The 102nd floor observatory is not really worth it. The views are better from the 86th floor. The attraction is handicap accessible. There are several checkpoints and bag checks upon entering so be prepared for that, not that it's an issue, but they did pull spray deodorant out my bag lol so maybe don't try to do this after a shopping trip when you're carrying several bags. Plenty of shopping in this area, so hit up 5th avenue while you're in the area.",5.0,4.5562000000000005
1463,Rip off,My experience was horrible! We purchased the tickets at 9:30 am for 12:15 pm. We didn’t have our vaccination cards so we weren’t allowed inside which is understandable however nor did we get a refund due to a 24 hour advance cancellation policy! So I only got a photo of the outside of the building. I had to catch a Lyft there that cost $97 paid $92 for tickets and $326 for a Lyft back. All that money and did not get to a memorable experience.That was a horrible rip off nobody has money to just give away,1.0,1.3566
1464,Empire State Building - Nice Retro Feel,This is a nice tour. All the interior finishes are clean and retro; it has attentive and polite staff in well-groom uniforms; the exhibits are multimedia and have enough detail; and the observation decks are good for rain and shine. I wish they had audio tour files for our use on our phones.,4.0,4.7558
1465,Better than expected,"We purchased the New York Pass to visit 4 main attractions. Out of all 4 the kids enjoyed the Empire State Building more. We went at 9pm and the views with the lights was amazing. No vaccination cards were required during our visit but was due to become effective the following week, so be prepared. There was no lines and entry and exit was very easy and streamlined. It was such an amazing experience.",5.0,4.922

1468,Empire State of mind!,"If you love art deco design and a stunning view of the tri state area, this is a great place to visit.

1475,Great experience at esb,I went there two days ago. I had a great experience of the empire state building. I especially like the elevator ride up which had a video of the empire state building being built. my one problem is that there's an elevator to the 80th floor which you have to take another elevator to the 86th floor. but you can see views of the building from the 80th floor and 86th floor so it was worth it. it also was not too crowded.,4.0,4.3065999999999995
1476,Loved it!,This is a must if you’re coming to NYC!! The views are incredible! We were also extremely lucky since it wasn’t too crowded and the weather was great!!,5.0,4.7082

1478,Worth it!,"We visited the Empire State Building at 11pm, towards the end of Summer in August. We had a pleasant experience. It was quiet, as we shared the space with about 15 other people. The view of the city lights was breathtaking. Would definitely recommend!

1484,Couldn’t see anything,Couldn’t see anything as it was storming but was not offered a refund or asked to reschedule and was a complete waste of money,2.0,1.8562
1485,Worth Every Penny,"35 years had passed since I entered The Empire, except for the phenomenal view it was a brand new experience!! My daughter and I so enjoyed the immersion technology experiences, history details, & artwork. Our tip is to pay for the upgrade, go to the tippy top of the 101th floor. You won’t be disappointed!
Happy 90th birthday ESB :)",5.0,4.7568
1486,Good experience,"That was a great experience between history and incredible views, from any of the observatory zones.",5.0,4.2498000000000005
1487,Disappointed,Paid the price that seemed to give a little special treatment but not one employee guided us accordingly other than to scan the ticket then follow the rest. So we didn’t get a red carpet. It was a rip off and I am highly disappointed,2.0,1.805
1488,New York,Awesome view once in a lifetime experience. Full filled one of my bucket list. Empire State Building is New York’s main attraction.,5.0,4.5928
1489,At the top of king kong,"Climbing the Empire State was a dream come true. Since I was 6 years old I saw king kong from 1933 and was fascinated, and I always wanted to climb to the top just like the huge ape. Going to New York and not climbing the Empire is like never having stepped foot in the big apple. I loved the building and its history. I think it's the most beautiful building that's ever existed.",5.0,4.9444

Definitely recommend the experience, but can only partially recommend the higher observation deck. We enjoyed it, but not sure if the extra cost is worth it.",4.0,4.8466000000000005

Not necessary mid week at 8:30pm.,"At that time of week and day-part, there's no line, so save your money and buy the regular admission ticket. The view at sunset is the best time of day to go up.

1532,Exceeded my expectations for the price!,"I initially considered the $47.91 (total) of the ticket to be a bit pricey for this attraction...... but the Empire State Building turned out to offer such a modern, updated, state-of-the-art experience that, in the end, I felt I more than received my money's worth.

The video presentations throughout the building were high-quality, and there were many exciting, unique photo opportunities throughout the experience. I particularly enjoyed the hall of celebrities that have visited the Empire State Building throughout the years, as well as the King Kong section featuring a fun photo opportunity in which it appears one is wrapped up in Kong's giant paw. And, of course, that view from the 86th floor...... WOW. It really feels like you are on top of the world! I think I could stand up there all day and dream.....

The Empire State Building provides an unforgettable premium experience, and I will gladly pay the price to visit again with others the next time I find myself back in NYC. ""If I can make it there, I'll make it anywhere......""",5.0,4.9832

1540,Dazzling Lights of Manhattan,I went up to the observation deck on the 86th floor of the Empire State Building and I was astonished by the amazing view. Being up so high and out in the elements has an enchanting feeling and cannot be replicated anywhere else. I recommend going up at night where every building is lit up like Christmas lights. The staff is very helpful and overall the place has a classy atmosphere. It lived up to the hype made by numerous films of the past. I know that I will return and try the 102nd floor next time and I would consider it an essential experience when visiting New York City.,5.0,4.9018

I will definitely go back and this time to go all the way to the top!! Thank you for making my trip to New York a great one!!,5.0,4.8870000000000005

We bought tickets for the 6pm tour and it was perfect because it ended by watching the sun set over the city. But before that, we had a wonderful guide who told us so many interesting stories and took us to many places in the building that aren’t available to the general public. This was probably our favorite part of our NYC trip this year. It was a little pricey but worth every penny.",5.0,4.9315999999999995

1555,Amazing,"What a memorable evening with my fellow New Yorkers . Just loved it 😍 wishing many more in future as the view from 102nd floor was undesirable. One gotta see with their own eyes, the twilight, the sparkling beautiful City lights. Photos don’t do justice .",5.0,4.8162
1556,"Beautiful scenery, unhelpful staff","The scenery and the cleanliness of the attraction was on mark, however, I was totally taken by surprise on how unhelpful the staff was. 8 of the 10 staff members we encountered were rude and unhelpful. They were also not knowledgeable about the attraction and the scenery when asked questions. I understand they deal with a lot of tourists, but the Empire State Building is literally a tourist’s attraction. The only 2 employees that were decent was a blonde Russian lady that actually helped us, and a wonderful black lady on the 102nd floor, that was incredibly sweet. All of the employees should be more polished, refined, and knowledgeable for their customers and guests. This attraction is a basic representation of our country, and needs to be employed with capable people that show a little more world class customer service to all guests. I have to say that if the experience with the employees was better, I would return. However, based off of this first visit, this will have to be my last visit as well. Very disappointing.",3.0,4.9568

1568,Rude Security,"I'm born and raised here in New York, Staten Island to be exact. This was the first time that I've ever been to the Empire State Building, and it will surely be the last. The security was rude and embarrassed me and my girlfriend.

On the 86th floor, there is an opportunity to be outside one of the most famous buildings in New York and take photos. When we got to the 86th floor I had asked a security guard if it was okay to take our masks off, since they are required, while taking photos of ourselves, and he said it was okay. As we were taking photos the same guard came over to us and started to raise his voice, telling us to put our masks on. He kept saying ""I don't care who you are"" which I have no clue what that meant, stood there with his voice raised as we put the masks back on, and threatened to throw us out. Now, there were many groups with no masks on doing the same thing we were so it was very weird that he singled us out, but nonetheless, it was very embarrassing and ruined the entire experience. It is disgusting that as paying customers we were treated like this.",1.0,1.168
1569,Interactive experience!,This is so much more of an experience now than it was when I visited as a kid. You walk through a history lesson about building it as well as a fun King Kong moment. I would highly recommend.,5.0,4.6032

1572,Wasted Money on Upgrade,"While the outdoor views from the 86th Floor are awesome, the views from the 102nd Floor don't change much and are not outdoors. I didn't find the 102nd Floor to be worth the extra money. It was crowded, humid, and there was absolutely zero social distancing. Mask were optional. Do yourself a favor and only pay to go to the outdoor 86th Floor Observatory. We also visited the Top of The Rock and The Edge observatories with the Empire State Building being my least favorite.",2.0,4.5326

1579,Beautiful Sunset from the Top of the World,"The experience was wonderful. It started off with no lines. The use of time windows for the visits allows for plenty of space between visitors. The employees were friendly, patient and helpful. The exhibits were great. It almost seemed like we were right there while the ESB was being built. This is a must do when visiting the greatest city in the world.",5.0,4.917

1581,Best day ever,"Incredible! Took our 4 yr old twins. They were entertained for hours. Great visit, worth entrance price",5.0,4.6796
1582,Kids were thrilled,"We took our 5 and 8 year old girls to the ESB and they loved it. ""Funnest day ever"" according to 5 year old - who is fascinated by buildings in general and loves heights, so kind of perfect for her. Lots of good exhibits and displays leading up to the main event.
One HUGE plus for us was we happened to go at a VERY uncrowded moment. Not sure if it was due to COVID or what - this was July 26, 2021 at 3pm, but there was NO ONE there which made it super enjoyable. Zero waiting in lines! The place was clearly set up for long lines to get through to and up the elevators and I can imagine a 45 minute line with young children could have made the experience MUCH less pleasant. Try to go at a low occupancy time if at all possible. I don't know how you can even find that out. We were just lucky and it made it a breeze. The girls want to go again!",5.0,4.9638

1586,A trip to the top of the Empire State Building,"This was one of the best thrilling experiences I could possibly have in New York City. If you come to the big Apple, you’ve gotta check out the Empire State Building at least once. Especially since you can go very high to the observation deck and get a spectacular view of the New York Skyline. I loved it here and I hope to visit again soon! Maybe I’ll try going to the very top to the 102nd floor observation deck. I totally recommend this for everyone especially those not scared of heights.",5.0,4.936
1587,Top of the world,Amazing view. They have done some renovation that makes the experience a lot better than few years ago.,5.0,4.5434
1588,Nice upgrades since last I came,"They've done some nice upgrades to the exhibit part of the visit since I visited a few years ago. It is a pricey visit--$95 for two adults after charges added in--but a ""must see"" if you haven't gone before. (I guess that's how they pay for those upgrades.) There are lots of picture opportunities and multi-media. They seemed to be set up so there was little crowding at the elevators and exhibits and things moved smoothly. The staff are very friendly. I asked one of them how they like working there. He said he'd been there 16 years and loved it. He said, ""You have to be a people person to work here."" No doubt! :)",5.0,4.8156
1589,Red Carpet not needed at this time,"The view was amazing, but a little too expensive. We paid for the Red Carpet experience, but really didn’t need it at this time as the lines were not long. I’m glad we did this, but I would pay that much to do it again on our next visit.",4.0,2.3116

When first entering with my date, we were yelled at by the doorman to keep moving along while my girlfriend put on a new mask. While we couldn’t have been there more than 15 seconds, and even though we were literally the only ones in the entire floor, the rude doorman came inside to yell at us to keep it moving along.

Along with that, the staff were almost all without exception very curt and rude. Demanding things like taking off our belts and jewelry to go through the metal detector with more vigor than a TSA agent after 9/11.

Views were nice, but overall experience was not. Would not go again.",2.0,2.278

I must've said at least three different times on our visit to the Empire State Building that I needed to leave a review. The employees were PHENOMENAL. Everyone made us feel so welcomed. They were full of information, even about other buildings in the area. We purchased tickets to access the 102nd floor and it was so worth it. My only complaint is we misplaced our ticket to purchase our photo. A staff member had told us not to worry, there would be a facial recognition option on the computer. Somehow that option was down at every single computer there? So we weren't able to purchase our picture.",5.0,4.6272

The views were fantastic and the history of the building and city while leading up to the outdoor observation experience is unmatched.

1634,Awesome experience !!!!!,I loved how we can go back in time to 1930’s and the construction of the building. The King Kong sight and how it moves around the building. And specially the view from the top 86th. Floor. Everyone said to me it is a waste since I visit another big building and more modern but the contrast with the Empire State Building make our experience the best. The gift shop is affordable and very nice things to buy. The only advice would be that pictures taken can be seeing before going to 80 th floor because we have to go back two times to see how we looked in the picture.,5.0,4.8994

I was so glad I hadn’t paid extra for Express Passes as there was no wait at all. The elevator elevators were great - very friendly and full of information. We enjoyed being able to walk all around the observation deck without crowds in the way of viewing the sites below. We went to the 102nd floor for the first time and it was worth going to.
Having been to the Top of the Rock, One World Observatory, and The Edge, I feel that the best views of NYC are from the 86th floor of the ESB. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit!",5.0,4.9638
1641,Horrible Empire State Building,"They have added hundreds of feet to the line area, with lots of displays. I suppose the purpose was to make the lines seem shorter, but when we visited, lines there non-existent. Instead, my handicapped self was led on several ""wild goose chases"" by employees giving contradictory instructions. It was better in the old days when you walked across a lobby to the elevators. All of this mistreatment for the more than $300 I paid for 4 VIP tickets. I felt more like a VMP (Very Mistreated Person) than a VIP.

Of course, the view is incredible, but it is just as available from several other buildings that are managed better.",1.0,4.9534

Disappointed because we can’t control the weather but I had asked if I can come on another day and I was told I couldn’t. I was with my friend from another state so it was time limited. Wish it would have been a better experience,1.0,4.5812

1649,Great attraction for family!,"I believe the building went through a renovation and it was so well done. Lots of interactive attractions, historic information and great pictures. I learned so much about the history of this building and loved seeing people of all ages enjoy. I’d definitely pay the extra to go to the 102nd floor.",5.0,4.9172

1651,Awesome!,"We celebrate our sons birthday with a trip and, this year it was NY. He loved it! Of the few NY attractions we managed to get in on our short trip, the ESB was his favorite. Beautiful building, great info on our way up to the observatory. Friendly staff, although a few of the girls at the photo buying booth we’re not but, everyone else was beyond awesome!

1657,Wonderful views,Was a great experience and I even got my husband who is afraid of heights up there and he enjoyed it very much. I would tell everyone about it.,5.0,4.6251999999999995
1658,Great way to view the city,A really great way to get a sky view of NYC. A truly pretty sight. I recommend it if you’re traveling solo. Very relaxing too.,5.0,4.8952
1659,Did not disappoint,Bought tickets in advance. Went at 330 on a weekday and there was no line! New videos and educational exhibits along the way were great! The whole family enjoyed the walk to the elevators- the ride to the top and the wonderful views.,5.0,4.8118
1660,Great Views,Always an impressive site to visit when in NYC! Be sure to buy tickets ahead of time and arrive 15-25 minutes earlier during peak times.,4.0,4.4176
1661,Surprisingly convenient,"It's been years since we've been to the Empire State Building. I was expecting long and painful lines, but the website was surprisingly convenient and we were able to get a reservation within 15 minutes. Very well organized and hassle free. All in all, a pleasant experience. And the views are amazing.",5.0,4.928
1662,Very good customer service,I was impressed by the quality of the customer service. Everyone was nice and patient. Very interesting exhibit and amazing views,5.0,4.8268
1663,Great trip,"Enjoyed seeing the city from above and the tour up to the top, however, some staff was rude. I was recording a video with background music and staff member told me I can’t play music while someone next to me was playing theirs.",4.0,4.2972
1664,Really fun visit to a NYC icon,"My family and I visited the Empire State Building and found the experience great. We went all the way up to the 102nd floor, which is much better for the very young, with its floor-to-ceiling glass. The 86th floor observation deck was fine for the adults and had you outdoors, but the sweeping views of 102 were the best. The visit also includes a lot of fun information about this grand old building, and we really enjoyed it!",5.0,4.96
1665,Ok,"The empire building was amazing, had wonderful views, but I got screwed by the pedicab driver outside",4.0,2.7188
1666,"For the money you pay, be sure you have a great camera","There are 4 ""observation decks"" in New York City and we only had time to do one of those and we picked Empire State Building for it's history.

We got the 86th floor express tickets (point to note: the 86th floor is the place to be if you want 360 degree views of New York City without a glass facade obstructing your view as that is what paying the extra price for the 102nd floor gets you) and went around 8pm.

Having express tickets definitely got us to the 86th floor quicker. You just follow the red carpet (yes, they rollout the red carpet for you which can be a bit dingy but I digress!). But realize that there are stops along the red carpet where you need to scan your ticket at a turnstile to be allowed access. There wasn't always an attendant at the turnstile but one was available nearby. Also, be sure to take in the history of this building as you make your way up. The route upstairs is well designed to make this happen.

On the 86th floor, you get walk around and take in all the sights and take all the pictures. Ensure you have a good camera! Overall, the experience was great, the staff were very courteous and I am glad we did this.",5.0,4.9670000000000005
1667,Exceeded our expectations!,"We didn’t have high expectations going here, as we didn’t know what to expect. It turned out to be an amazing place and very well thought out with the exhibitions and flow of traffic. We just happened to experience an amazing lightning and thunder storm at the top of the building. It was absolutely breathtaking and fascinating to watch. If we are ever back in the area, we will do this again!",5.0,4.9184
1668,Better than I had remembered,They have really improved the entrance to the elevators. They provide a lot of history and exhibits as you wind through the lines to the elevator. Even King Kong is part of the fun. The views are worth the price of the ticket.,5.0,4.6442
1669,ESB was amazing,The displays on the way to the elevator were entertaining and educational. The elevator ride was quicker than expected(less than a minute.) The views from the 86th were amazing. The wire fence/ railing didn’t affect the views. Worth the lowest price tickets. No lines July 2021.,5.0,4.1718
1670,Great experience for the family,My family and I (6 of us) took the tour all the way to the 102nd floor and the view is hard to top! We spent most of our time on the 86th floor main observatory which was open and had fresh air and where most people go. The 102nd floor is accessed via an elevator on the 86th and is completely enclosed. If I did it again (not likely because it's kind of expensive) I'd save the $ and just do the 86th floor observatory passes. Most of what you're there to see can be seen from the 86th. The 102nd is very small and usually crowded so photos up there aren't as easy to take as they are on the 86th.,5.0,4.168
1671,Engagement at the top of ESB,"Incredible views,clean, and friendly staff! Not over crowded. July 2nd, we got engaged. It was a beautiful day. We watched the storm come in from the west. Will never forget our experience!",5.0,4.8022
1672,We were astonished by the tour provided by the Team!,"Everyone was so helpful and made us feel so special, even with all the other there too. Every aspect of safety was impressive and I would like to call out the treatment we received from who I believe was named Regina, exceeded our expectation by far. I believe we first encountered her first dealing with us on the street and she was so pleasant, even though there were other tourists not cooperating with her very much. And then we saw her again on the 102nd floor later on and she was a pure pleasure. If I am wrong, as i do not recall seeing her ID badge when on the street, and there were two different people helping us and interacting with us, all i can say is BRAVO for hiring and retaining what we believed to be true assets to the experience. I believe Regina (if that is her name), who was on the 102 floor on June 30th between 12 and 2 PM, said she had been working there for more than 20 years.",5.0,4.9564
1673,Renita for the win,"Loved the tour !!!! It was by far more than our family expected. Our guide was Renita Edmond and she was FABULOUS, she was funny, very knowledgeable and great with our kids!!! Hands down our favorite experience in NYC!!!",5.0,4.932
1674,Great views and good service,"We mad an appointment but were running late, they worked with us, changed our schedule and the experience was wonderful. Great views and great decoration from room to room on your way up.",5.0,4.907
1675,Awesome views,We enjoyed our visit to the Empire State Building. The VIEWS were amazing and the exhibits were fun.,5.0,4.772
1676,Fantastic Experience,A wonderful visit and perfect timing as it wasn’t too crowded on a Thursday. Even in the misty rain it was an incredible experience,5.0,4.6251999999999995
1677,An incredible experience,"My husband and I took our first trip ever to NYC last week. One of the things he really wanted to do was go up to the 86th floor of the Empire State Building, and I'm so glad we did. I was impressed from the start with all the displays explaining the history of the building -- especially the part where it was as if the workers were all around you doing the actual construction. I wish we'd spent a little more time looking around and reading in that part of the tour, but we were anxious to get to the top! On the 80th floor, we got a preview of what we'd see on the 86th, but it was from behind glass. The sight took my breath away! Once we got outside, I was surprised by how much smaller the observation deck was than I thought it would be. But man, oh man, that view! I could have stayed out there all day looking at the amazing stretch of buildings on all four sides (but especially looking south). I paid extra to go up to the 102nd floor, which was cool but not really any more impressive than the view from the 86th. Also, on the 102nd, you're looking through windows again. Overall, I would highly recommend a visit to the Empire State Building to anyone visiting NYC to kind of get your bearings and see just how densely packed Manhattan is. It's a must-see sight!",5.0,4.9584
1678,Amazing Staff,"I want to commend the wonderful staff at the Empire State Building. From the conversation I had on the phone prior to purchasing tickets, to everyone whom we encountered during our visit, every single person was helpful and super friendly. We also very safe regarding security and COVID measures. Thank you so much!",5.0,4.9524
1679,Great experience and wonderful view,"We visited June 30, 2021 - so some things may change COVID/Entry wise depending when you read this. We paid/reserved a timed entry for the first entry period of the day (noon) the evening before our visit. Received a prompt email with instructions on where to enter and mask requirements, as well as tickets attached. When we arrived there was a long line which moved very quickly once the doors opened. There were two staff members checking tickets outside and helping those who didn't book in advance. Everyone was friendly and helpful. Upon entering masks were required and after a bit of a walk you go thru a metal and bag Xray scanner. Had no problem bringing in plastic Nalgene water bottles (their website says no bottles - but I think that was more for glass). There's a long museum area, which we just breezed thru because it was crowded with people taking photos and playing. As a result we were some of the first people on the 86th floor which was great. There are many attendants around if you have questions and the whole experience was fun and enjoyable! The views are grand and being able to say you went to the top of the Empire State Building is worth the $40 per person!",5.0,4.965
1680,Best NYC attraction for Kids!,They’ve done a wonderful job of turning this historic Art Deco building into a tourist attraction that appeals to kids and families. The entire experience was fantastic! Our twin 6 yo boys loved the moving images of construction workers and best of all the room with a life sized King Kong hand and video of him peering into the window. The adults and kids loved the views. Best tourist thing we did in NYC!,5.0,4.9704
1681,Much improved!,"I went to the Empire State Building probably 10 years ago and all I remember is the long lines and climbing stairs to the observatory deck. Wow, have they really changed it! It feels more like a museum - more history on the building and interactive displays. We went on a Friday afternoon at the end of June and there was no line. We bought our tickets and went up immediately. We only went to the 86th floor but the kids really enjoyed the view.",5.0,4.67
1682,Empire State Building,"Fantastic! Would recommend this to all! The experience was amazing and the views breathtaking! A very well produced experience. All staff were so friendly, sincere and engaging. The displays were incredible, really gave you the feeling of what it was like at the time, during the construction and opening of the Empire State Building. The gift shop is excellent, too!",5.0,4.9756
1683,One of the world’s best recognised landmarks with and experience to match.,"The Empire State Building is deservedly one of the world’s most iconic landmarks and monuments. The experience and hospitality matches its status.

The sophisticated multimedia experience is both educational and entertaining.

The experience of the visit reinforces a sense of being part of something singular. Meanwhile, the professional and hospitable team guiding you on the journey relieve and anxiety about safety and allow you to immerse yourself in the view.

Well done ESB!",5.0,4.849
1684,"Top of The World, ma...","What a great experience it was to visit the Empire State Building. A great tourist attraction / experience. BEWARE of sightseeingpass.com, what a rip off and scam company. The sightseeing pass SALES PITCH was awfully convincing, and promised savings and value beyond belief.... WELL FOLKS, when a company says that ""More Details will be provided you AFTER you complete the payment.... What a sucker I was! Our two days in New York were wasted trying to find out what we could actually use of the 'package' and then ""Talk to the Hand"" when trying to get a refund (we didn't use any of the ""pass"" and are disputing this with our credit card. DON'T DO IT!

sightseeingpass.com, everything had restrictions and 'scheduled' appointment times that if you missed your time, ""go pound sand"" Well, it turns out that the schedules are NOT at the attractions BUT IMPOSED by that scam company. WHAT REALLY MADE IT UNUSABLE was that the fact that our attractions were closed on Monday, Tuesday (WTC, NatHistory, a few others) and that fact was obscured to make us complete the purchase and revealed after the fact. SEE THE Empire State Building, it is amazing! but don't get involved with sightseeingpass.com, the reason new yorker's get a bad rap...",4.0,1.6098
1685,A very expensive most,When visiting NY the ES is a most and they charge you kniwing that. Good view of NY but the cost is too much for wgat this is (USD40 per person),3.0,3.4764
1686,Must See if in NYC,"My family and I were visiting all the way from Guam so this was quite the adventure. We purchased the Express pass to the 86th and 102nd Floor although there wasn't a line for people with express pass to go to. Thankfully the lines weren't that long so it was fine. We did the sunset tour which was magnificent. Although the ticket is timed, you do not have a time limit, you just have to check in by your ticket time. When you get to the Empire State building there're several entrances but you have to go to the one all the way down on 34th street. The night view from the 102nd Floor was amazing, I'd pay the extra money.",5.0,4.7652
1687,Amazing!,It was so good. The view was so beautiful. Definitely would come back. It was a little nerve wrecking going to the 100th floor. But it was such a good experience.,5.0,4.8187999999999995
1688,Best part of our quick stop in NYC!,We loved how they spaced out entry times so it wasn't crowded. We were able to walk around and see everything from every angle easily!,5.0,4.5288

1691,Expensive Pictures!,The website to purchase tickets was not user friendly. Wish someone was there to sell tickets. They had plenty of helpers.,1.0,2.1624
1692,Renita made the experience magical!,"We had a wonderful experience tonight at the ESB. We bought the Express Pass and when we got up to the observation tower on the 102nd Floor, we met an INCREDIBLE person who works there - Renita. Despite wearing long sleeves and pants in very hot temperatures, she was kind, friendly and helpful. She went “WAY BEYOND” the call of duty and she took dozens of pictures of us on both the 102nd and 80th floor observation areas. And she was not only gracious, but she took AMAZING PICTURES for us. She was an Angel and a tender mercy as we were celebrating a birthday. She made it an incredibly special experience. Thank you Renita for making our night so special!",5.0,4.9746
1693,First time visiting,It was my first time in NYC. The views were fantastic and absolutely gorgeous. There was almost no wait time.,5.0,4.5794
1694,So much better than expected!,"I had not been here since1995 ... the improvements are wonderful! We were late to our reservation but the ushers welcomed us in. I appreciate the personal service at every junction. There’s entertainment in the elevators and interactive spots to learn historical background ... all that before the actual observation deck!
Everything is clean and well maintained. Nicely done!",5.0,4.9516
1695,Perfect place to visit,"Amazing view and experience. I recommend it to everyone. No lines, not too many people unlike some of the other observatories. Great opportunities for pictures of the city",5.0,4.7914
1696,NY VISIT,The videos and graphics about the history and movies made at empire state building were very entertaining.,5.0,3.9854000000000003
1697,Must See,We visited the Empire State Building on Friday June 25 around 1:15 p.m. We bought are tickets online and were able to walk right in on time. There was no line at security or throughout the first level of the building. It was great to be able to stop and take pictures without having throngs of people around. The elevator attendant for the most part kept the elevators to one family at a time. By the time we got up to the observation decks there was far more people so we were sharing an elevator. All of the workers were friendly and knowledgeable. One of the floors had view finders to look at different landmarks there was no sanitizing in between patrons so be sure to bring your own wipes. The kids loved the King Kong room and the views from the 86 and 102 floors. The 102 floor is very tight and packed but worth it. We made a rookie mistake and bout drinks from the gift shops only to find out that when you take the elevator back to the ground floor to leave you actually walk through a convenience store (i believe it was CVS or Walgreen) with reasonable price drinks and snacks (more than half off the gift store price). I read online that there were only bathrooms on the 86 floors - this is incorrect there were bathrooms on almost every floor we stopped on. I'm not sure if they are making exceptions because the number of people is reduced due to covid. Also they were allowing you to bring water bottles in. We had our stroller and it was easy to navigate.,5.0,4.8782
1698,Worth it!,"I had my hesitations of this one but I was wrong. i wasn't sure if this would be worth the money. We ended up staying for 2 hours so I felt it was. You'll see the construction of the building, surrounding sites and then head up to the open air floor and enjoy spectacular views. Very well done.",5.0,3.7622
1699,Surprised!!,"I have been to New York many times but never visited the Empire State Building. So this time I brought my two teenage daughters and thought we would give it a try. It is very expensive!! So I was worried we would be mad we spent they money. However, we were so surprised by how much FUN it was. It feels a bit like a ride at Disney at first but the history, videos, movie history that you walk thru before you ever go up is amazing! It’s done in stages and so interesting! Then we get to the top and it’s so beautiful. But this was the best part…. the lady working the top was the most kind, fun and best picture taking rockstar! I wish I could remember her name! Rolinta, Rolanda. Ugh that I can’t give her the right shout out but thank you to that sweet soul for making that 225 cost worth every penny ❤️",5.0,4.9925999999999995

1701,Loved it! Upper Deck is AMAZING!!!,"We had a great time! The exhibit was a nice enhancement to the experience. I visited 25 years ago and it was a quick elevator ride up,15 minutes on the 86th floor and a quick elevator ride down. This is definitely worth the ticket price!",5.0,4.8036
1702,Beautiful but expensive,You are moved through pretty quickly. I've seen it twice. The historical information is fascinating. They've added a few bells and whistles since I last visited in 2014. It is very expensive though...what isn't in New York however.,4.0,4.5434
1703,A worthwhile experience!,"We went the weekend before July 4 and lines weren't long at all. We waited maybe 1 elevator car before being able to board and go up to the top. If it had been crowded, there's so much to see and read on the way up that it keeps you interested and engaged. More information about the ESB than most people would care to take in but again, no lack of things to do while waiting if lines are long. It was a little cloudy for us that day but we were fortunate to miss the rain. The gift shop afterwards is awesome as well.",5.0,4.8802
1704,Summer 2021 visit to NYC!,"We had a fantastic visit. We are from Washington, DC and just excited to travel by train as our first trip since the pandemic started. The ESB tour was something our 10 year old son was excited to see since he has an interest in architecture and building large structures using Legos. The views were spectacular and the onsite staff made the visit more enjoyable. Thanks so much~",5.0,4.8998
1705,Empire State Building,Have not visited the Empire State Building for years. The changes are amazing and very educational. From the time you walk in the door until you leave. My 13 & 10 year old grandchildren were so excited and we all had a great time!!!,5.0,4.8268
1706,VIP Guided Tour - A MUST,"We visited the Empire State Building with Docent-guided tour tickets. There is so much more to see than just the observation decks. The tickets were well worth the cost and I HIGHLY recommend the VIP guided experience that takes you to more places, skips the lines and takes you to BOTH observation decks (86 and 102) as well as the exhibits and other areas of the lobby level you can't see with standard tickets. 10 out of 10 would do again. The extra money for the VIP is absolutely worth every penny!",5.0,4.9352
1707,"Very Nice view, poor personal attention.","Visit was very nice but is not fair that when you come out of the 86floor, you can't go to 82 and keep visiting, you just have to go out.",3.0,2.7964
1708,Not ADA friendly,"Right now you must buy your tickets in advance. We arrived 15 minutes before the arrival time and stood in a line that we hoped was for the Empire State Building. No communication for the staff. It they had a person telling everyone to have their tickets out and ready the line would go fast, but when you reach the check in area outside that's when you find you need them out. Luckily I had mine out so we got to pass a lot of people struggling to get their passes up on their phones.

This where we had problems. My sister uses a walker. When we reached the doors the only option was revolving doors, not good for a person using a walker with vertigo problems. Once inside no one to tell you which way to go. We reached elevators and everyone was waiting for them. Turns out they only went up one floor because they were for people who could not do stairs. No signs, no one to tell us that, so we had to stand in a long line for an elevator to take us up one floor. That was maddening.

It is a long walk through all kinds of cool exhibits on our way to the elevators to the top. You can spend as little or as much time as you want. Once up on the top the views are awesome. My 4 year old grandson never wanted to leave. Once you go down you are directed to the gift shop. Lots of cool things to buy. WE checked out and followed the exit signs to find our selves facing 2 rows of escalators! No signs of an elevator. So I got my sister on the escalator and held her walker over my head to get down the escalator. Come on New York you can do better.",4.0,4.2132000000000005
1709,Go Big or Go Home,"Go Big, splurge & go up to the 102nd floor, you won’t regret it. The glass elevator ride was just Charlie & the Chocolate Factory. The history, decor are detailed & you just can’t take it in in one visit. Order direct & order it w/ lunch. I’m glad I went",5.0,3.1032

BRAVO - good job",5.0,4.9472000000000005
1725,Do it!,"I was nervous going all the way up to the top of the building, but it was amazing, and I totally encourage everyone to do it! Renita, the fantastic person at the top, saw my ashen face and gave me the courage to go all the way to the window. I can't say enough good things about her, she's amazing. Plus we now have a fantastic family photo of all of us with New York in the background!",5.0,4.9719999999999995
1726,Still in awe,"Three of us purchased tickets for the Empire State Building on Tuesday, June 21, so that we could view NYC at dark from the 86th floor. From the first staff me met thru the last staff person, their courtesy and support were top notch. We were in awe of the videos depicting the building of the ESB, as well as the stories of famous visitors. It was incredibly clean and sparkling. What a joy. What a treat. What a gem for NYC.",5.0,4.9174

1728,"Fun, even in the rain!","We booked tickets ahead of time and it was raining when we got there. However, it was still a great visit! The museum that you walk thru in the line is terrific. We really enjoyed the exhibits. We went to the 86th floor and braved the wind and rain outside!",5.0,4.8716
1729,Amazing views,"Amazing views for a birthday trip with my mum.
Couldn’t have asked for a better way to spend the sunset over New York! Breathtaking",5.0,4.7496
1730,"Beautiful view, unique experience","Must visit at least one time in your life. Beautiful view from above, good gift shop. Some interactions includes, but not so much.",5.0,4.3084
1731,Went for the views but my biggest impression was of Renita,"This is what you expect from a place where the attraction is being very high. I would rate it higher if it weren't for the ticket prices (that being said, I'm still glad I went). There is an exhibit with historical information that most people seemed to ignore in favor of photo ops. Once you get up to the 80th and 86th floors it's all about the views. But our best experience was on the 102nd floor and it came in the form of a woman named Renita (I think I spelled that right). Renita has been working there for 22 years and she is very good at her job. I watched her calm a hyperventilating teenager and get her close enough to the glass to see the view. She then talked to a 50-60 year old gentleman, who didn't want to leave the region of the elevator, until he was taking in the view with everyone else. She is so calm and so assured and wants so much for everyone to be able to enjoy the view, that I can't imagine anyone being more suited to the job. I hope her employers know what a treasure they have in her. If you see her up there, say hello and give her a smile, she deserves it.",4.0,4.9796
1732,Great outside experience and unique buildup,"So in the last couple of weeks, we have been to the Willis Tower in Chicago and we also did the One World Observatory. I had felt like we had our fill of big buildings with observation towers. We almost didn't do the Empire State Building but did it on a whim- we were out walking and it was pretty near our AirBnB and we had time to squeeze it in the evening. So glad we did- it was definitely my favorite of the three. Being outside is a big step up from looking through glass. Their feel of the 30's building and the Kong stuff and everything was unique and better than the other two. But, again being outside at night with the clouds swirling and the top above us lit up was magical. Felt like being in a batman movie. Great experience all around.",5.0,4.9744
1733,Sunrise Eclipse from the 86th floor,"The 10 June 2021 sunrise was extra special, as it was paired with a partial solar eclipse. What an incredible view!

While sunrise eclipses won't happen again in NYC for quite some time, I'd certainly suggest considering a sunrise event at the Empire State Building. Since the 86th floor observation deck uses metal railings, rather than glass, it's great for photographers too.",5.0,4.7176
1734,Empire State Building VIP tour THE BEST experience,"This was our first time in New York and of course my family and I had to see the Empire State Building. We were in New York just shy of a week and we were going to do the Empire building last. We thought we would splurge and do the VIP tickets because we knew would probably only be here this 1 time. It was the best decision we made. First we had some issues with the 3 of us getting all on the same time. We purchased 2 tickets but we were not able too get my tickets. I called and spoke with a supervisor who helped me with changing the times so we could all be together. He had issues but said that it will all be okay and we could show up and they wi help us. We got there when they open and explained our dilemma. They put me with Angelo Mansion and he was awesome. We were not only able to put all 3 of us together but he took my name down and said he will take care of us and he sure did. He put Renita E as our tour guide and we could not have been more blessed with her. We felt she went above and beyond for us. Whether that was her job or not but she made us feel like real VIP people. She was able to answer all our questions whether we thought they were stupid or not. She made our experience like no other. Renita made our final stop with the Empire State Building the most memorable experience we could have ever asked for. If by chance we get back to New York before she retires, we will definitely ask for her again. Thank you to Angelo for getting us all together and thank you Renita for the awesome time we had and for going above and beyond for my 80 year old mom who loved you tremendously. She will be talking about you and the building for the rest of her days. We enjoyed our tour so much.",5.0,4.992
1735,It's a Touristy thing to do. But you have to do it!,"We did it our 1st day. I waited longer to go to Time Square. But I'm not sorry I did it. You have to. Everyone has. King Kong has been there more than once. I actually want to shout out the super helpful Staff. I walked up to the door guy and told him I left my tickets on the counter in the Hotel and I didn't have a smart phone. He radioed ahead, let me in anyways and with my credit card and ID the nice lady at the ticket booth on the 2nd floor re-printed them for me. I really really appreciate that. We only went to the 86th Floor. But my ears popped! And the pictures are great.",4.0,4.9612
1736,Truly magnificent,"Make sure you leave enough time 1-2 hours to view the history and exhibits on your way up. If you want to see the sunset from the top, worth it, but schedule you time slot at least 1 -2 hours before sunset so you don't have to rush through the history of this magnificent NY landmark.",5.0,4.7738
1737,Trip to nyc,We were just walking around on Sunday morning and just happened to be by Empire state building around 11 and decided we would do this while here.Very easy to get tickets and start out tour.Ticket agents out front were very helpful walked you through each step if you needed any help.The views were beautiful from the top floors really enjoyed our visit,5.0,4.8718
1738,Can't wait to go back!,"It was an amazing experience. Everyone was professional, friendly and inviting. The visual in the first elevator on the way up was impressive.
The Starbucks coffee for the sunrise experience was definitely an added bonus and the guys were super nice. My tip for anyone who visits the top is make sure you take in the view from all around, East and West. I would also suggest that you visit the gallery before leaving...it is worth seeing.",5.0,4.9652
1739,Great time,It was a wonderful visit! The employees were all very informative and helpful. The views were simply amazing!,5.0,4.8064
1740,Not a View Like It,"With Covid we had to book a time and buy tickets online. It was very easy buying them and using them once there. The Empire State building doesn't disappoint, it's the best was to see the city 360 degrees and it's iconic. We also purchased the add on meal at Tacombi. The meal was awesome and more food than we could finish.

When you get to the ESB there are uniformed attendants that check to see if you have a ticket. Once you enter the door they check your temp and require a mask. They help you to an elevator and send you up. On the roof of the elevator they play a short movie type thing of the ESB being built. We both thought it took away from the experience and why I put 4 stars, we felt they were over-hyping it when it doesn't need to be. You stop on a floor that winds through the history and pictures of famous people who have visited. This didn't interest us much and we thought it was cheesy so we just walked through it without reading the information, etc. Then you come to another elevator ride up to the top. The views really are amazing. We were 2 of about 16 people. They do ask that everyone moves in the same direction but they weren't really monitoring it. At the end they ""force"" you to go through the gift shop, another reason for 4 stars..",4.0,4.862
1741,"Great View, Even Better Memories!","As a long time resident of NYC, I am probably one of many who have not been to the ESB. I never imagined a simple Monday afternoon with nothing to do could of led me to one of the most memorable view and experience I won't stop talking about. The staff are phenomenal and the trip to the top was so informative and fun, you forget there's still the top to get to. I fell in love with the city all over again.",5.0,4.7694

1747,Tour with Renita,"Did the 90 year anniversary tour and our tour guide was Renita. She is the best guide in the world. She went above and beyond to give us the best tour. She also is a great photographer and took tons of pictures of us which turned out great. She made us feel like family. I would definitely recommend taking a tour with her. I had been to ESB before, but this time I learned so much and had a perfect experience because of Renita.",5.0,4.913
1748,Amazing =),It was a very nice and controlled visit. After covid I was afraid of crowds on closed buildings but this attraction has manged it very well. I felt safe and enjoyed it very much!,5.0,4.9264
1749,AMAZING!,"Visiting the Empire State Building was at the top of our daughter's bucket list. She's a huge Percy Jackson fan and she needed to experience this for herself. The elevator rides are all worth the visit. For us, it's better than going to a theme park since our daughter is in a wheelchair. We took her to the tippy top where we were greeted by an amazing woman who works there. She shared all about the city with us and took pic's of us as well.
We ventured back down to the gift shop to buy some souvenirs. After we got back to our room we realized that an item hadn't been put into our bag. I searched and searched how to contact the gift shop and finally found how to contact them. Within 10 minutes of me sending the email someone had called me. I shared our situation along with a copy of our receipt and the giftshop manager agreed to mail our missing item to us. Thank you to all the staff that helped us we really enjoyed our visit!",5.0,4.9719999999999995
1750,Worth a visit.,"This was on a bucket list, and it did not disappoint. The whole experience from corny, to fascinating, to impressive views was unforgettable. You get the history (with visual effects), a bit of Universal Studio, many photo ops, and of course, the views all in one package. I recommend to get tickets to both 86th and 102nd floors, and go early, to bit the crowds.",5.0,4.78

1758,Wonderful experience!!!,We had such a wonderful experience at the Empire State Building. I would so recommend anyone who visits NYC for the first time to tour the Empire State Building. So worth it!!!,5.0,4.7506
1759,So Much To See,"The whole experience was really amazing. So many different rooms including museum style learning all about when and how it was built, along with several areas that focus on signature movies that include the ESB and finally the sight seeing alone with the outside walkway to see all the views. Definitely worth every penny.",5.0,4.5426
1760,Much more than an elevator ride!,Much more than an elevator ride! I did not read the description of the tour of the Empire State building and assumed it was just seeing the skyline. This is far from reality the tour takes you on a trip through the building. They show you the history and construction of the building and many other historical events that have taken place through the displays. Our family thoroughly enjoyed the experience.,5.0,4.1948

1762,A must see in NYC,"Empire State never disappoints! Views are breathtaking!
We bought our tickets online. It was a weekday after Covid so it was relatively quiet. Staff are very attentive. Ticket prices are high but it is a classic and needs to be experienced at least one time in your life.",5.0,3.9796
1763,Stunning Views & Rude Staff,"This was my 3rd time going to the 86th Observatory of the Empire State and I’ve never had an experience quite like this one. My family arrived about 15 minutes early and had our tickets scanned outside and we were told to go ahead and enter the building. We went inside where there were a few other groups waiting. No staff were present and we all waited another 10 minutes or so. Eventually we tried scanning our tickets at the kiosk in the lobby. After a few more minutes the elderly gentleman who scanned our tickets outside came in screaming that he didn’t know why we were still down in that area when we were supposed to go up. We had not received any instruction on what to do at the door, nor had the other groups. The staff on the upper levels were more helpful and the views were spectacular.

I don’t think the disorganized, chaotic experience was worth $300+ and maybe the rude employees shouldn’t be the one’s greeting guests.",2.0,2.1906
1764,Empire State Views at Night!,"I'd previously been to the Empire State Building during the day but never at night. My sister in law suggested we do that for our next visit and I'm so glad we did! It was STUNNING seeing the city views at night!!! I'm not sure if because it was night time or because of Covid, but there was no line to get through security or riding the elevator to the top. Highly recommend going at night time to take in the spectacular city lights!",5.0,4.8988
1765,Very enjoyable even with foggy weather.,Even though visibility was low due to rain and go you could still see a good 30 blocks or so of the buildings below. Unfortunately the horizon was too foggy to really appreciate. The experience inside though is very entertaining and educational. I had a great time walking through the exhibition while going up to the observation deck outside. It was also intersting and different being up there in the rain and fog among the clouds. I always remember it. The staff was also super friendly and really cortoeus and helpful. You could tell they loved working their.,5.0,4.9428
1766,Good way to experience New York,"I did not grade it as 5 for two reasons.
- The price is on the high side, but what bothers me is not that but the $2.18 ""convenience fee"" per person. I really have to wonder what kind of the convenience I was paying for buying the tickets through a buggy web application.
- We asked the employee on the top to take a photo of us which he refused. I completely understand the reasoning behind and would not have even mentioned that here if he had responded with few words instead of just waving his head. Aren't basic English and politeness requirements for the such job?",4.0,2.157
1767,I would do it again!!,"What can I say about my visit, I will say that the staff was very very kind and did an amazing job. Social distancing and sanitizing at all times. It was a beautiful and Fun experience, One I will never forget. It was worth paying what we paid.",5.0,4.9108

1770,so fun!,"Such a fun experience, went on a day when it was rainy and cloudy but still a gorgeous view! Indoor section was basically a museum about the building and the gift shop was huge! Wish the little telescope viewer things had been opened (covid💔) but maybe next time.",5.0,4.9218
1771,Eh it was fun,"It was quite fun and totally cool to see. My only issue was the security. They have you go through like a TSA type thing like at the airport. I had something of mine taken cause it wasn’t allowed in the building, they give you a ticket and when you’re done, you have to leave and be escorted back to security from the entrance to get your belongings back. It was a little unnecessary.",4.0,4.8596
1772,Nice changes,Love the animation in the exhibit area. Still a little overpriced in my opinion. Also- too many people in the elevators while in a pandemic. I’d rather wait longer than be crammed with ten or twelve people who may or may not have been vaccinated and/or infected.,3.0,3.5
1773,Great time!,"My daughter and I came visited the Empire State Building for our second time on 5/29/21.

It was worth it! In early May 2021 there was almost no crowd (we were vaccinated and wore masks of course). The 360-degree views from all sides of the building, inside and out, were spectacular. We could see many famous landmarks, including the Statue of Liberty, Freedom Tower, Pepsi Cola sign in Queens, Verrazano Bridge, etc. I've been to the top of only one other skyscraper--Willis Tower in Chicago--and I found the Empire State experience much more exciting. Also, you learn a lot about the history of the building through the interactive exhibits on the way up.",5.0,4.8426
1808,Still the best view in the world,Making the most of my time in NYC included a trip to The Empire State Building. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. The views are breathtaking. They do a great job of giving you the history of attraction in digestible bites. And the gift shop had something for everyone on my gift list - including me. Go now.,5.0,4.9322
1809,A must-visit site in NYC,"I had only been to the ESB as a child with my family, years ago. I went with my girlfriend, just hours before proposing to her, and it was so perfect. She'd never been and was impressed by the exhibits, professionalism of the staff, and lack of lines (I'm sure the pandemic contributed to some of this). There was sanitizer throughout the building and ionization machines clearing the air. What a cool invention! I felt like the flow of tourists was well managed, and by the time we got to the 86th floor, we'd already seen plenty of cool videos and exhibits. Of course, the view from the observatory is unmatched. I'd recommend to anyone.",5.0,4.9108

My sister was in touch with their amazing admissions and operations team on the accommodations my son would need ( no wait time in lines, possibility of him taking his mask off due to his sensory issues) , no wait time in elevators to reach different locations in the building. They did an amazing job facilitating our trip and we were given VIP treatment as we toured each floor. Amazing job catering to the neurodiverse community.

1830,"AMAZING staff, great views, a bit too much “extra” on the way to the viewing floors","My partner and I have lived in nyc for many years, and I’ve got a family history connected to the ESB, so to be honest, we were really only there just to see the view from each offered floor. Thus, we personally found the amount of guided tour stuff, winding pathways that you’re required to go thru to get to each elevator, the loud audio randomly & suddenly plying tour info (even though you can download a guided tour if that’s of interest to you) extremely excessive & kind of frustrating. Wished we could have spent those minutes taking in the view a bit longer. Also, the elevators were extremely sensory overload, my partner has asked burgers and the audio volume/videos/effects etc were so extreme that he had to cover his ears. I am usually not bothered by that stuff, but I also was so put off by it that I had my ears plugged each time. That being said, once we actually got to each floor, the views were stunning, and the staff were absolutely lovely. 102nd floor is definitely cramped… A lot of people were sitting in the windows, there was even a few kids curled up sleeping while their parents sat in the windows, which made it hard to get around them, or look through that particular window. My partner was actually planning to propose up there but he felt there just wasn’t enough space (he did it a little later at a wonderful dinner, but I think he was disappointed). However, we fully understand that there’s only so much that can be done w both the amount of safe available space as well as the COVID situation & number of people. So while it was a bit frustrating to climb over sitting adults and sleeping kids (not babies, I swear I’m not that heartless), it was all 110% worth it to watch the sunset from that floor, and we had an absolutely hilarious & truly helpful guide in Jere; he deserves a raise frankly! All this to say, no matter what complaints we may have, the absolute majesty of this building & its view, as well as the people there to guide you through it all, will always overrule and minor inconveniences. Plus: Sunset was unbelievable, even on a cloudy day.",4.0,4.9754000000000005
1831,Dream come true,"My boys read about the Empire State Building and talked about visiting it for months. Finally, their dream came true. It was an amazing experience all the way up.

They have done a good job at making it an experience before you go up, and the elevators are awesome!",5.0,4.7318
1841,sucked. to much money for you are allowed to do.,Its time to join the other states and open up. Covid is over....and things need move forward. Seats need to be there to watch the sunset. you pay that much money to go up in the first place and extra to see the sunset. You should be able to set down and watch it. we are outside. you make us wear a mask anyways you could have a place to set. You also rush us to go thru it and you can walk around more then once to get different pictures at the sunset. way to much money for what we were allowed to do and see.,1.0,3.4046

I was extremely disappointed when security would not let me take my tripod in, the whole purpose of my visit was to take night time pictures of Manhattan skyline! I do not recall seeing this ban mentioned anywhere when I bought my tickets online. The official explanation was that due to crowds there is no room for a tripod on the 86th floor terrace! I think they should make this very clear when you buy your tickets.",2.0,1.3684

1859,"Iconic and Majestic - and ""Boston"" thanks John!","Iconic, majestic, classy - simply a great experience from the first greeting by warm and classically dressed staff, to a few floors of inter-active marvel at the construction of this building, the chance to meet and greet with King Kong - and then the views. The 86th floor, outside, experience at night time was amazing for us - it kept both my teenagers fully entertained and each different side offers a completely different view.

Big shout-out to John, security on the 4th floor - he noticed that one of my kids had some apprehension on taking the elevators and being up so high on a building. Not only did he take the time to calm her nerves, he basically was nice enough to give us a mini-tour to show the strength of the building, the speed of the elevators and how many celebrity visitors had the same experience as her. I understand it was not as busy as usual because of Covid - but the fact that he took the additional time and actually checked in a couple of times after we came back down...truly set this experience apart. Take into account that we're from Boston; and he claims to be a fan of the dreadful Yankees - John, if you get to read these comments, thanks for making a difference. Go Sox!",5.0,4.911

Clean, well maintained and modern designed, a little pricy to just enjoy the views, but for as well it was maintained and as good as things looked and plenty of staff to guide or help you out, I guess they are putting the money to good use.",5.0,4.966
1896,Great experience!,We loved every detail about the Empire State Building and can not wait to come back. Everyone who worked in the building were very professional and very helpful. It was so comfortable because of how clean they keep it. Couldn’t have asked foe a better time with my other half!,5.0,4.8704
1897,Best experience ever!,"We had the experience of our lives! Every part from bottom to the top is unique and wonderful! The staff over there was super nice and generous ESPECIALLY RENITA at the very very top! She was an Angel and took amazing photos for us, made us feel very welcome and very happy, She know the city very well and it's super helpful! Overall I recommend the visit to the very top it is worth it!

We went on Feb 2021 and the building was very clean and very safe.",5.0,4.9872
1898,A nice respite from COVID,"Having not been since I was a teen, I visited the 86th floor with my children and it was so nice to be up on top the majestic Empire State Building during COVID, when there was no crowd, no waits, and therefore plenty of space and time to enjoy the views. As a local, I found the cost exorbitant (~$150 for one adult and two children), but that aside, it was lovely.",4.0,4.664
1899,First Time,"Had an amazing time visiting the Empire State Building. This was a last minute trip with a ""friend"" visiting from Texas. I can't believe I waited so long to take the tour.",5.0,4.1718
1900,That skip-the-line ticket,I highly recommend the skip-the-line ticket. Because it's usually quite the line. But the vista is totally worth the time.,5.0,4.1398
1901,Great Visit!,The new additions since I last visited are great! It was a great visit and my daughter loved it! Definitely recommend,5.0,4.9154
1902,An experience of life time everyone should at least try once!,I always believe that the best part of any place is the people. ESB is no different. The entire staff team were professional and beyond expectations. Our tour guide Renita was exceptional. She is the best part of the entire tour. We love it so much that we want all our family and friends to experience it. Highly recommended! Everyone deserves to experience NY at its best even during it’s most difficult time.,5.0,4.9234
1903,Great experience,"The view alone needs no recommendation, visiting is a bucket list must. Now is the time to visit - short to virtually no lines and very attentive staff. Everyone that works there is so friendly and helpful, really made the whole experience that more enjoyable.",5.0,4.4322
1904,Empire State Building,"Aesthetically there is nothing eye catching or striking about the most iconic famous building in New York. Especially from the ground level its just like any other block of bricks in the city. You can walk all around it forever without knowing that this building is known world wide.

However what makes it really special that it was the first ever building that surpassed 100 floor mark and it was all built in record time ahead of its opening date in only 18 months.

I mean it takes longer for local council to fill a pothole in the road and to erect a building like that from start to finish is just plain amazing. And it was all done in black and white 1931 when there was no high tech state of the art machinery to speed things along.

For that reason alone it deserves all the glory it gets",5.0,4.6958
1905,Amazing View,"We loved it. Amazing view of beautiful NYC. Try to book in advance so you do not have to wait on line, well there were actually not so many people due to Covid.",5.0,4.8574

1907,SO WORTH IT!,You won’t regret it! We went at night time and the views of NYC never get old especially being born and raised in NY.,5.0,2.0494
1908,Spectacular View,I think every corner of the city is as beautiful as it can get. The authorities have also been regulating it quite well keeping the pandemic in mind. It is must visit if you are in New York. Empire State Building also gives you a better view of the city because it is almost at the center of the city as opposed to One World Trade Center.,5.0,4.6958
1909,Sublime views,Incredible sunrise views and extraordinarily helpful and friendly staff. Access was easy and tickets afforded plenty of time on site.,5.0,4.672
1910,Truly amazing,It was truly breathtaking to be at the Empire State Building. I would go back 1000 more times for sure. But next time I definitely would recommend going to the 102nd floor.,4.0,4.7786
1911,The VIP tour is worth it,"We celebrated our fifth anniversary with a VIP Premium tour and were eternally grateful that we had the good fortune to have Renita as our guide. Her warmth, humor, knowledge and candor made it a one of a kind experience. She effortlessly rattled off facts and figures without sounding like she was reciting from a script. She took the time to get to know us and when she showed us around, it didn't feel like a guided tour so much as she was introducing us to an old friend. It's an experience that we'll never forget and Renita was a huge part of that.",5.0,4.9504
1912,Apiece of Newyork,Piece of work showing greatness of New York over the years. Architectural mile stone and masterpiece worth exploring,5.0,4.4368
1913,Loved the tour - Renita is the best!,"I had the pleasure of doing a VIP tour with Renita and she made me feel like I was a part of history. She knew every nook and cranny about the Empire State Building - both pre- and post-renovation. And she was kind enough to snap photos for me(I was solo). I couldn’t see myself doing the tour again with anyone else. Loved it and love her!

Happy New Year, Renita.",5.0,4.9586
1914,An EMPIRE Experience,Visiting Empire State Building in a new 360 view was on my top of the bucket list to do this year. every piece of infrastructure is a masterpiece with mesmerizing views and greetings. Totally worth the visit and the best observatory in the city. As Empire State Building is in the center of the City one can clearly see the whole New York City at a glance! As a content creator it gave me a perfect opportunity to cover the best part of the city. Thank you Empire State for your existence. Love You!,5.0,4.976
1915,Over the top security,"I am a music director of a high school band and was touring NYC with 100 students from another country. NYC was the culmination of 2 years of fundraising.

During our visit to the Empire State Building, we were on the Observation Deck and it was very crowded and I was stuck near the back. As I am vertically challenged, I could see very little. In front of me was a permanent telescope available for public use with a little platform. On the platform was the word 'Stand'. So I did. And I could see a beautiful view. Unfortunately, within seconds I was told by one of the security on sight to get off the platform (the one that specifically suggests one should stand there). My response was to oblige but I asked why it was I could not stand where obviously it is meant for standing. His response was to not be a smart ass or else face arrest. He then called for back up. Other people around who could hear the conversation, started to get irate at this officer for being so unreasonable and it was getting tense so rather than escalate the situation further, I told my students to meet me in the foyer. I had to cut my visit short and leave alone.

Back on terra firma, or at least in the foyer, I registered my complaint to the supervisor. His response was that the staff are overworked and the specific officer was probably tired. Which means what exactly? Was the action condoned?

It is unfortunate that my only visit to this remarkable piece of engineering (I doubt I will ever get a chance to visit again in my lifetime) was marred but an overzealous and power hungry staff member. It certainly left a sour taste in my NYC experience, one that I will relate for the rest of my days.",1.0,1.0946
1916,Great Facility!,"After many work trips to NYC, I finally managed to get to the Empire State Building. I arrived way early, but the staff let me in almost two hours early, as there was no one waiting due to covid. The building and the presentation were awesome! The staff was also great! Evaristo from Costa Rica, who was working the top level of the building, was also awesome. A true gentleman!",5.0,4.9496

1918,Helpful staff,Worth a visit and lots of information on the building before going up to the top. The staff were helpful and the scenery was beautiful.,5.0,4.711
1919,NO REFUND during COVID-19,"We had arranged a visit NY but due to the rigid COVID-19 restrictions, we had to cancel the trip. We do realize that this was a 'no refund' event but my goodness. I emailed with no response. I would have appreciated an email of some sort. They made money off of us and we got nothing in return. Not even a pass for next year or whenever. Sad. We will NOT be recommending this particular tour to anyone - that is for sure.",1.0,2.6938
1920,Great landmark and museum,My entire party enjoyed the experience. From toddler to senior citizen. It was great! We only made it to the 86th observatory due to cost (party of 7),5.0,4.7716

It did not disappoint.",5.0,4.5282

1929,Great VIP tour at the Empire State Building,"This was an amazing tour, including skip the line, both the 86th and 102nd floor observation decks, and the celebrity green room. The best part was our tour guide, Renita Edmond, who was an absolute joy of a tour guide. Engaging, well-informed, and warm, she was only interested in us having a great time, and she definitely fills the room with her presence. If you get Renita for your tour, you are in for a great time at the Empire State Building.",5.0,4.9658
1930,Highly Recommend,"First off, the tour was absolutely stunning. Our VIP Ambassador was Renita Edmond, and she was amazing!! She was so much fun and super sweet.

1932,Excellent!!,Staff very kind and an amazing view!! ..the museum is verte interesting. The reservations are very easy to make,5.0,4.8642
1933,Once in a lifetime experince!,"Expensive but worth it! For me this was most likely a once in a lifetime experience. I really enjoyed the exhibits and photos downstairs before taking the lift to the observation decks. Even though it was a slightly cloudy day, the views were just breathtaking from up top. One this I noticed at the very top was how clean the glass was, this facilitated perfect views and excellent photographs too!
Had the pleasure of talking to staff member Tara J who was working on the very top floor, while I don't have a massive fear of heights, my legs do tend to turn to jelly and Tara was really friendly and good humoured and whilst being professional and made me feel really comfortable being up so high. My dad and I spent a while talking to her, and it really just made the experience extra special hearing about her life as a New Yorker and even hearing her personal story of 9/11 was incredibly touching. Thank you Tara for taking the time to speak to us, as this was my first time visiting New York from Scotland, she made this experience really special.",5.0,4.994
1934,Blessing from God,"Our VIP tour by Renita Edmond was absolutely MAGNIFICENT! She is a blessing! The absolute best! She’s been working there for 22 years so she knows everything that needs to be known about the building and more. Plus she is kind, sweet and funny, she makes you feel valuable, important and like family. She made sure we got the most out of our tour and she made sure to take us great pictures too ! I mean what else can you ask for? Unfortunately it was a cloudy day so we didn’t get to see the city but Renita made sure that we get other tickets at no extra cost to come back to the observatory once the weather is better and the tickets have one year until they expire. You see? She is a BLESSING!
There's so much to see and learn in this building and if you are thinking about visiting the Empire State please ask for Renita, you’ll never regret it!
Loved her so much !",5.0,4.973

1937,Excellent,"Took my little sister here for her 14th birthday and went all the way to the top 102nd floor, the view was amazing and the overall service was outstanding. Everything was well structured and the workers were very nice. Since we went a little later there weren’t many people which made the experience that much more better.",5.0,4.9032
1938,Covid couples photo shoot,"The last time I went up the Empire State Building was probably about 15 years ago. It's just one of those things. If you live in NYC, it's kind of just there, and you would never really go.

Fast forward to 2020. A friend told me about a 'free' photo shoot for Covid couples on the top of the building. I use the word, ""free"" loosely because while you do get 5 free professional shots, you still need to pay for the ticket to get up there, which ended up costing about $90 for two people. We knew it was kind of a ploy to get people to go, but we decided - how often do you get to have professional photos taken at the top of the Empire State? Plus, it was our wedding day! So it was a pretty easy decision. We signed up for a time slot online. There was an entry time slot and a photo shoot time slot. We were a bit late to for entry, but it didn't seem to matter. They have the lobby set up very socially distanced - lots of ropes and signs everywhere. We got up there in time for our photo shoot time slot, but was a bit of a mess because I don't think they anticipated just how many Covid couples would show up. We ended up waiting about an hour, but I would say it was worth it to get some nice photos. They took about 20, sent everything to us a few days later, and we got to pick 5 from which they remove the watermark.

As for the building itself, we didn't really stick around to explore too much. But I think it was probably because we live here. I'm sure if we were tourists, we would have spent a lot more time there, and enjoyed the 360 views.",4.0,4.9146
1939,Excellent,"We really enjoyed this visit!
The staff was very welcoming,organized and helpful! It was an amazing experience!",5.0,4.8136
1940,Covid Friendly Visit,Wow! I've been to the Empire State Building several times and this was the best. Due to Covid-19 they are limiting visitors and it was awesome. No lines at all. We almost had the entire observation deck to ourselves. They did a great job maintaining cleanliness. We felt very safe and enjoyed our visit. My one complaint is you have to buy tickets online and cannot get around the convenience fee - which is a major inconvenience.,5.0,4.9208

1951,A definite must see when in New York,"A world class exhibit with unparalleled views of an unparalleled city! The ground floor exhibit walks you through the history of the storied building, from conception and construction up to the daily use and life within it and does so in a fun and interactive way. The ride up to the top is smooth and quick, and you can spend as much time as you like lingering outside. I found it best to go up before sunset and staying until after the sun goes down as you get to experience the city ""coming alive"" as the lights around you start coming up and the sun sets below the horizon. Simply beautiful. I also can't speak highly enough of the amazing people who work there. Manager Angelo was very courteous and friendly when assisting me with a ticketing issue. And I can't say enough great things bout Renita up on the observation level, she's such an engaging and super friendly sweetheart. She's been there over 20 years and loves her job and it definitely shows! When you go, see if you can find her and experience her charm for yourself, you won't regret it! All in all, an amazing experience through and through.",5.0,4.9904

We purchased tickets online and proceeded pretty much directly to the elevators taking us up to the 86th floor. Along the way to the elevator, we actually took our time to enjoy the many exhibits that are usually meant to pass the time while waiting in line. Once we got to the 86th floor, the views were awesome. And since there was probably only about 20-30 other visitors, we had plenty of time and elbow room to enjoy the views.Oh, and everyone, everywhere, was wearing masks, so that was good to see as well.",5.0,4.9164

1976,Overall very nice experience,"My parents surprised my husband and I with tickets to the 86th floor.

The overall experience was very good. There was no line. I was informed that they opened the observatory at the end of July. As you walk through, there are so many details, informative plaques, theatrics, and history regarding the building, which I particularly liked.

After going through security (if they confiscate anything you may have an opportunity to take it back at the end of the tour at the gift shop) you take an elevator to the 80th floor, then to the 86th. For an additional 30 dollars, you can go to floor 120. From the top of the observatory, you circle around and then exit through the gift shop. Regular priced tickets are around 45, the reason for my review. I just don't like the price, but I will say that everything was really well done and it was a very nice experience.

1978,Breathtaking,"We were in New York City in October 2019 and were lucky enough to visit just after the new interactive displays on the 2nd floor were complete. These in itself are wonderful to see and shouldn't be skipped or hurried. After this we took the lift to the observation deck on the 86th floor. However, we stopped short of the 86th floor and were asked to line up behind a railing facing the windows which were covered. After listening to a short story about the building, the window coverings were raised to show an amazing view of the city that left us breathless. We then went to the 86th floor and ventured out onto the walkway. Even though the wind was blowing, it was amazing to see the city without having to be behind glass windows.",5.0,4.8434

1980,Fantastic experience,We've decided to go up the ESB and be the real tourists of our city. This is the best time to do so. There was maybe 10-15 other people besides us and we got to enjoy all the views. The sunset was very romantic and going up to 102 floor was definitely special.,5.0,4.8824000000000005

1982,Pricey,"About $45 per person to visit. Expensive even compare to other NYC Observatories. Other beautiful skyscrapers in UAE and China are weight much better than the Empire State Building.

I didn't have the opportunity to visit it until last year when my cousin came to spend some time; she asked me to take her to the observation deck at the top of the building. We paid a little extra for the express tickets (skip the line). It is exciting to be there, the view is spectacular, the helicopter virtual ride was incredible, I felt like it was real.

It was nothing short of spectacular. It was a beautiful clear day. We had the whole 102nd floor to ourselves (and the security). Everything was immaculate and everyone held to the proper protocols and precautions which made our trip safe and wonderful. And the views!!’ Wow! From the Hudson River to the east river to the statue of liberty and the freedom tower to the Chrysler building and Central Park- all breathtaking as you see planes taking off and landing from LGA and JFK!

And the exhibits, 3D panoramas, King Kong. Picture worthy. Surpassed expectations.",4.0,4.6988
2002,Nice!,Nice views at the Empire State Building but the windows/bars outside may obstruct the view. The observation deck at theTop of the Rock/Rockefeller had better views but overall wasnt as nice as the Empire state building. The Empire state now has a small King Kong exhibit which is nice and the souvenir shop is really nice. You can also pay to get a printed Souvenir photo which is better than Top of the Rock because they have you pay for a blurry digital copy.,4.0,3.003

2009,Top of the World,"We visited the Empire in our trip in September '19 one evening and it was an experience not to forget. Mostly thanks to having now need to queue (10pm meant there were fewer visitors than normal).

2010,Breathtaking Views,"I had an amazing experience.
The view was beautiful.
My only complaint is that we were told closing time was 11 but we were being rushed out at 1040. At one point we were the only people on the 86th floor and we were asked to move from our spot for being there too long. I was not aware there was a time limit for standing somewhere that I paid $50 to see. It was kind of rude.",4.0,2.4128

2019,Employees not happy,"the gentlemen that helped us scan our tickets was incredibly helpful and kind. Unfortunately that was the only employee with that attribute. it seemed as if it was possibly understaffed so this may just be a management issue ? it was not clear where we were supposed to go (i heard multiple other visitors ask only to be scoffed at) I had to ask when getting off the elevator which way to go and it seemed to bother the employees every time. They all seemed short and frustrated with their circumstances. obviously the view was beautiful and the features indoors were just as interesting. Great landmark , just wish the employees were not so upset to be there.",4.0,4.8606
2020,A must do for tourists,"We were on a trip/holiday and wanted to get in all the sights. The Empire State was one we wanted to do. It was a great experience.

2022,"Amazing experience, but unpleasant photo lady 😔","Honestly this is the most beautiful view I have ever seen before , and what makes it better is that there is no lines I came about 1pm today , everything is so clean as soon as we would touch something you would see someone coming behind you to wipe it down even the stair handle , this deserved so much More than 3 stars , but what caught my attention was how rude this photo lady was , she had terrible customer service , I had to learn by my self how to find the photo and as I was leaving she didn’t explain , she said “do you want it ? No okay good bye have a nice day” don’t think that was pretty nice , so I decided to take another look because it wasn’t a bad picture but a tall gentleman helped me and I got to buy a package which was an awesome deal ! If you come to the Empire State Building try to ignore her , I don’t remember how she look like but she was thick and had curly hair and a purple shirt , other than this please visit an amazing experience",3.0,4.9524

2025,not the best visit,"When we arrived to the Empire State Building we were told we could only purchase tickets online. I then asked about the military/veterans discounted tickets as my husband had just retired after 23 years active duty. We were told they were not available because you had to buy all tickets online. Not sure why there is not an option online for military?veteran tickets. As well, there was no one inside to tell us where to go. We were waiting for some guidance. There was no one to take our group photo either, kind of disappointing since it was my husbands birthday too. Over all was not the best experience for our group.",3.0,1.3934
2026,A must visit!,"Amazing! Going up to the top is an experience in itself, with interactive activities and many facts about the history.

2029,Can’t beat the real thing!,I’ve been to the ‘top of the rock’ but this wins out for me personally. Stunning views and you’re experiencing history first hand. They could perhaps put a bit more of an effort into exhibitions to make them more informative.,5.0,4.8818

2034,Pride and Disappointment,"You have an incredible historic building and A beautiful view. But your customer service is horrible, information And customer relation 0. I’m writing this because I believe you can do much better.
My sister and I bought our ticket on the spot, at the time we asked if we were able to get to see the view from the top because it was getting ready to rain and we weren’t sure if it will be possible, we were told that it was fine and got rushed in purchasing the ticket and we went in. Every floor and every setup was incredible! the place will take you back in time and to the present, it was a sight to see. You all have done an amazing job with the building and the history behind it.
But once we got to the top we were told by the attendants that we couldn’t go on the observation deck to see the view because it was raining and that there was lightning as well. So we waited almost over two hours in a dark room surrounded by windows and very limited view. Even after the rain had stopped we kept asking all the different attendants hoping one of them will have an answer for us on why we couldn’t go outside to enjoy the view, all we got was the manager downstairs hasn’t given them the authorization. After many failed attempts to speak to some one with authority, and noticing that they were getting irritated by our questions, we gave up and left the building.
I’m disappointed because they could have told us the truth from the start that the observation deck was closed due to inclement weather, secondly once we got to the top someone could have made an announcement on the changes rather then us asking questions numerous times and no clear answer. Most of the attendants were very unfriendly and seamed bothered by our questions. I hope you make some changes moving forward so others won’t have to experience what we went through. You have an amazing building with a large historical significance don’t let it be clouded by bad management and personal
I hope you’ll do better next time",3.0,4.9536

2036,Great day with my son's,"As typical New Yorker I probably have not been to the Empire State Building since a class trip in the 1970s. I recently decided to remedy that and took a trip with my two teenage sons. It was a wonderful experience. The history and views were spectacular. But what made the day most heartwarming for me was my interactions with all the staff. The were all so kind and helpful and made myself and my boys feel as though we were on a private tour. The highlight of these interactions came on the 102 floor observatory. Ms Nerita ( I hope I remember her name correctly) helped my younger son, who has a disability, feel comfortable and enabled him to enjoy the experience. There is not a price that could be put our experience because of her and the entire Empire State Building staff.

I went on a Wednesday evening at 6pm in August. I was THE ONLY PERSON there. At the end of my time another person came. There were lots of staff around to show me where to go each step of the way. They were very friendly but it was a little sad there weren’t more people there. Not that I minded my special experience. The gift shop is huge and has lots of nice things.

2050,great experience except for the photo guy,"We went there after it reopened. It was great, had a good experience and got to enjoy the view from the top. Almost all of the staff were helpful and nice. Almost all, because the guy at the photo told me and my 8-year-old (did not ask and did not say why) to TAKE OFF OUR MASK! This is unacceptable in a closed space, with so many visitors, at the time of a pandemic, where it is proven that masks are one of the best ways of dealing with this deadly virus.

Apartment and get some fresh air while on top of the city. There’s no lines, no wait and plenty of space. Not to mention it’s a perfect way to support an Historical landmark. Nows the perfect time for fellow NY’ers to act like tourist and see your city that you live in. It helps support it as well.",5.0,4.9796
2063,Beautiful iconic building,"Spotlessly clean. Gleaming like it had only opened yesterday. No crowds, no lines. Staff helpful and attentive. Fabulous!!",5.0,4.6434

I would like ti emphasize staff, amazing people, friendly, professional. The whole tour is fantastic. Thanks!",5.0,4.946
2065,The new updates are amazing,They do so much to make sure you’re safe and healthy. We had the place to ourselves for the most part and the views were the best I have ever seen! Gift shop is well laid out and prices good for official gift shop. The new animations everywhere are Disney good! Well thought out and executed. We had an amazing experience. You’ll never have this easy of a time to get in without lines,5.0,4.9738
2066,Excellent stay!!!,"It was excellent! They have excellent precautions, safety and cleaning measures. We did not have to make a line so it was fabulous, some areas are obviously closed due to covid like the binoculars things, but still a great view of NYC!",5.0,4.8848
2067,definitely recommend,"I hadn't been here in about 25 years and wanted to check out the new exhibits. Since there aren't any tourists in NYC right now, there wasn't a single other person in the ticket area, security area, bathrooms, and new exhibit areas. When we reached the 86th floor observatory we finally came across some other people. So this review is for anyone considering visiting right now (summer 2020).: DEFINITELY come see this icon. It will never be this empty again. Employees were all very friendly, the interior is beautiful, and the building was immaculately clean. The new exhibits focus on the record-breaking construction, and on the building's role in films/pop culture. They are pretty interesting and there are a couple of fun photo ops along the way. We wanted to be there for sunset so bought tickets for one hour ahead. That was more than enough time to go through the exhibits and get up to the 86th floor. The photos they try to sell you are overpriced and also pretty ugly. But the gift shop has a decent variety and the prices are surprisingly reasonable (for a tourist gift shop).",5.0,4.9418
2068,We basically had the place to ourselves.,"No waiting, amazingly gracious and helpful staff, super efficient contactless process and all very clean!
It’s a little sad to see the city so quiet, but a great opportunity to see and support some of the sights without the crowds.",5.0,4.9358

2074,Rooftop Vibes,"Understandably, there weren't many people on the 86th floor observatory, which made it much more comfortable and enjoyable. The staff were very friendly. The breeze was a comfortably cool. The views were amazing. However, there was a guy on staff (presumably Indian) who watched me and my friends very closely (I would hate to think it would be because we're black), and took little notice of the other tourists (other races) in the observatory. I was slightly annoyed, but I wasn't going to let it ruin the moment or good breeze.",5.0,4.4816
2075,Historical but you can get better in NY,"This is no doubt an historical building. If you would like to go there because if it’s history then for sure you should go. If you are going because you want the best view or vibe, then this is not the place. The building is very old and there are nicer options all across town.",3.0,4.6352

2078,overrated,"Overpriced and overrated. It is cool to see Empire State from street, but I would not pay to go up there at that price. This should be a free national landmark.",1.0,4.5804
2079,As amazing as I remembered from when I was younger,"I first visited here back in Dec 2003 on my first holiday to New York however this time it was my hubby’s first time going here.

Queues were horrendous but well worth it when we finally got up to the top. Views were amazing",5.0,4.7936
2080,1st visit,"Excellent visit. Ample staff, all staff were welcoming, pleasant, polite and helpful during our visit. Exceptional job following & controlling Covid-19 guidelines. No lines, social distancing, everyone wearing mask. Our family felt totally safe. Experience overall was wonderful! Beautiful views! Every inch is photogenic. My only suggestion would be to take more than one photo and let people choose which one to purchase. I did not purchase the souvenir picture because 2 of our family members eyes were closed. I do plan to take another trip to the Empie State Building soon with family member. We visited during the day. I look forward to visiting at night.",5.0,4.943
2081,Great visit!,Wonderful visit. It was completely empty so it felt a bit like a private tour. We went there with our 16 months old toddler and took her in a carrier. It was so easy. No queues and a wonderful view of beautiful Manhattan.,5.0,4.8642
2082,Amazing Experience!!,This place is spectacular! Literally nothing could top the experience we received. The views are gorgeous and you feel like you’re on top of the world! Staff was awesome and very friendly. Extremely clean facility!! Would highly recommend everyone to see this place!!,5.0,4.9288
2083,Beautiful experience,"This is a must as a visitor to New York. As a child I have seen so many movies that have the Empire State Building in their scenes. I was not disappointed. The views, and feeling of being on top of the world is extraordinary. The museum is great and interactive for children, and the staff are really friendly. We enjoyed the experience so much, its a memory that will live with us forever.",5.0,4.8866
2084,Fun multimedia experience,"I visited during COVID 19, so I had the whole place to myself. All of the employees were so kind and helpful, even during this bizarre time. I went during the morning and the evening. I bought the express pass (which was not needed at this particular time) for each, but they have a regular pass that is discounted for day and night viewing in the same day.

There were a lot of fun photos, exhibits, and info. There are also a lot of photo ops, especially the neat King Kong exhibit. You can learn a lot of history while seeing different views from the 80th floor and the 86th open observatory. Unfortunately the newest 102nd floor observatory was not open, but the open observatory was plenty enough in my opinion.

I recommend seeing during the day and the night. They are very different experiences.",5.0,4.844
2085,Perfect NYC Experience,This is the best way to experience the heart and soul of Manhattan. It was so much fun seeing the history and the construction of the building. And the views of New York City are unreal! We had a blast. All of the staff were so nice and dressed to the 9s!,5.0,4.8364
2086,Beautiful and well managed.,"The museum part of the building was very nice on the lower floors, and the outer portion was a better experience than the Freedom Tower due to you being outdoors. Weather was pretty good so that may change if it's not. Nobody rushed us through any parts. The only negative was that the gift shop sells many many different items in addition to shirts and hats. All of the models of the building are pricey and we were unpleasantly surprised to walk into one of those cheap ""NY Gifts"" shops all over Time Square, the shopping districts, China Town, etc only to find the same models of the building for 1/3 the price.",5.0,4.8696
2087,I cried,"I had legitimately dreamt of going to the top of the Empire State Building since I was four. I've been coming the city every year for my whole life, but was never allowed to venture out on my own. This was my first trip traveling to New York being ""old enough"" to adventure on my own. My experience was a thought altering experience that I will continue to relive in my future travels to the best f***ing city in the world.",5.0,4.7585999999999995
2088,Great landmark!,Will go back to New York and visiting this attraction is a must. It is also nice when they made a slideshow of the famous personalities that went to the top of the Empire State.,5.0,4.5928
2089,First visit after 20 years,"The renovations and the additions to the building make it a real experience. There's so much more to it than an observation deck. There are interactive displays, a detailed history of the construction, and artifacts from the decades of building occupants. And the 102nd floor is now floor to ceiling glass windows, with an unbelievable view. Well worth the money.",5.0,4.1718

2093,Amazing experience!,We visited the first day the Empire State Building reopened. Everyone was so friendly and helpful.

2099,WHAT A VIEW AT NIGHT,"Visit the Empire State Building is a must when visiting NYC and I highly recommend you do it at night. We visited around 10pm at night and we didnt have to queue at all which was a relief because we nearly booked priority for a lot more money!

2105,Iconic,Empire state building is a must see for anyone visiting new York. We went in the night and it was quiet with no long queues that you normally get during the day. But be prepared for the freezing cold when you walk out at the top level. They do have heaters outside. The views are amazing. Don't pay for the extra to get to the very top level as it's not worth the extra money. There is lot of information inside the building as well and you can easily spend 3 to 4 hours inside.,4.0,4.8636

2111,"NYC's ""must see"" skyscraper","The Empire State Building was, for many years, the world's tallest strucure. This Art Deco skyscraper was built in the early 1930s, the depths of the Great Depression. The Midtown location, though it doesn't worry tourists, was bad for busness. It's 1,454 feet (445 metres) tall. The Empire Stae Building is on every tourist's bucket list.",5.0,2.6471999999999998
2112,The top of New York,"Once you get past security you'll use an elevator that will rush you up 80 floors in just a few seconds and will make your ears pop, once you arrive you can go out and walk around the sides of the building to see New York in every direction. Almost everything else shrinks as you look down and you can see all of central park beneath you, you can see the edge of Manhattan island and the 911 memorial tower. You can see every bridge and very tiny people below, just make sure you don't lean over when taking photos because you may lose your camera. The only issue with it is that there will be a lot of other people visiting so it'll be crowded, but besides that it's a great way to see the city.",5.0,4.5984
2113,Fantastic,"After some people said to miss this place off, we decided to do it anyway. It is an iconic building and we are glad we went. The king Kong section was fun, putting on our best damsel in distress look for photos. All the exhibitions were great and informative. The views amazing. We preferred this over TOTR. The staff were lovely and happy to pose for photos. All in all, a must do.",5.0,4.9432
2114,First Day NYC - You Just Have To,"Our first full day in NYC, can't believe we weren't going to bother because someone told us that the Top of the Rock would be better because the Empire State Building would then be in your photo's which is a good point but then wherever you go in the City it ends up in most of your photo's anyway.

We went early before it started to get busy, we had been told it was a bit pricey but as it's New York everything is pricey and we might not get the chance to come back.

What a great morning that was, enjoyed every aspect of the visit, loads of pictures, superb !",5.0,4.9344

2120,"Boring, look at buildings, nature","I visited NYC back in the summer of 2017 to the empire state building. I wasted about $39 just to look at tall buildings, trees, water, and the sky. It was no fun. Plus going up the empire state building was so windy that it nearly blew my hat off. It is also dangerous since its so high. The only thing they can only brag about this building is that it was built in the 1920s or 1930 and king kong was filmed in 1933 before the disgusting hippies and babies born in the mid 1920s to 1950s destroyed america. How vicious and disgusting they were and still are from the day they were born til now.",1.0,1.1014
2121,A must see attraction in New York,"This was always on my bucket list when visiting New York and it was amazing. However a few tips before booking this. There is no information once you've entered the queues, if you have elderly relatives, small children or any health issues, you could be waiting a very long time standing, there is no information given to the length of the queue etc and they seemed to go on forever, one after the other, some waiting time information would have been useful. A bit chaotic getting to the top.
However once you've waiting and gone through the queues and security it is well worth it. Not great if you don't like heights!
The views on a clear day are spectacular and you can see for miles. It does get very busy at the top as you would expect but worth every penny.
We went early morning and were at the top in around an hour. The history of the building was a nice interesting touch on the way up.
The beautiful Art Deco of the building is amazing, such an iconic building you simply must visit.

This skyscraper and views over NYC has featured in so many documentaries, films and photos, there were no real surprises, however still fantastic.

The Art Deco features throughout the building are timeless. Thoroughly memorable. Hopefully the existing world shutdown will pass and visitors can again share our experiences of NYC",5.0,4.862

We were here just before the civid-19 lockdown, virtually everything else inside was closed, but not the Empire State Building. And there were very few visitors, I can imagine that in ""normal"" times it could be very crowded.
This is not just a visit to a viewing gallery, but you start off with excellent displays and film clips on construction of the Empire State Building including the iconic photos, so well known, of the construction workers sitting on steel girders. Also information on films that the building has featured in - remember King Kong!
The fast elevators then take you to an internal 360* viewing gallery with large picture windows before re-entering the elevators to be wished up a few more floors to the external 360* viewing balcony. Wonderful views!

About 33 years prior, I visited ESB with my dad as a young teenager. Being from New York, the memories I have of NYC are some of the best with my Dad. Every year for Spring Break, we (myself and my daughters) do a road trip to anywhere in the US. This year, my daughters decided on NY - So I'm like Let do it...

We drove into the City, spent some time there and wanted to see ESB, Statue of Liberty and Ground Zero. Our First stop was Empire State Building (ESB), actually our first stop was China Town to get some amazing Chinese food.

Then, we Lyft'ed to ESB and purchased our tickets. Our first impressions of ESB weren't so great because the employee's just seemed like robots, going through the motions, if you will. Until we arrived on the 102nd Floor. Renita E, was Amazing, helpful, outgoing and willing to take pictures, willing to be in the picture and so much more. She even announced to everyone on the floor at the time, that I was sharing the same experience with my daughters that my dad shared with me some 33 years ago - I was almost in Tears...

Thank You Renita E, you are an amazing persons, you love your job and it shows. I wish all your coworkers were so engaged as you are. They all can learn something from your dedication, loyalty and energy that give off to guests who visit EBS.

Thank You, Thank You and THANK YOU!!!",5.0,4.9912
2146,Top of the bucket list!,"This was top of our bucket list and it definitely lived up to the 'hype'! The outside of the building is magnificent and the inside, after seeing it in movies & on TV, was so much more than we expected; the history behind it is fascinating and worth taking your time over. We visited around lunchtime and had spectacularly clear views, which you have to experience to fully comprehend. I didn't want to leave and can certainly recommend it to any visitor.",5.0,4.9198

There were only a handgul of people visiting, mostly Brits I noticed!, so it was a walk through the entrance and exhibits to the lift. The staff were so friendly and welcoming. The interior is art deco and has to be seen to be believed, thinking this was done almost a hundred years ago is mind blowing. The fog was thick and it was windy but we did get to step outside briefly.

We didn’t need a hard copy ticket, they just scanned our online code. The second floor is a general exhibit, then an Elevator will take you to the 86 floor with more exhibits and windows views to the city. The telescope is pointing to a city or a landmark.

2170,BRILLIANT!,"I was in New York a week before Christmas with the whole family so we decided to climb up the iconic Empire State Building on our final day as it was within walking distance of Times Square; where we were going for lunch.

Before you head up, there is a 12ft sculpture of the Empire State Building itself. This is a good opportunity for taking pictures infront of it. After security, there is also a gallery of the history and clips of the Empire State Building when it was being built. After, you pass through another gallery of signed items and photos of famous people who have been up the Empire State Building. I found this a particularly nice touch as well as the timeline video on the Empire State Building being builton the ceiling of the lift as you climb to the first observatory. The first observatory is indoors. This is good because here, you are less preoccupied about dropping your phone/camera, the views from here are still amazing. However, we decided head all the way to the the top and my goodness, the views from here are
Spectacular! You can see right the way across New York (there is also an even higher observatory at extra cost!). When you arrive back down, there is a massive gift shop, with everything you ever imagined! This is especially great because it gives you a chance to buy any souvenir you wish.

I would like to thank all of the Empire State Building Observatory crew for giving me such a fantastic experience and I will be sure to be back up it if I return to NYC.",5.0,4.9864
2171,Top of the list for any visit to NYC,"We had planned a visit to the ESB for 6 months prior. We purchased tickets from a UK agent (GetYourGuide.com) as this worked out cheaper. We visited on March 12th - literally just days before the city closed due to Coronavirus. As a result of this, there was no queue at all, we walked straight through security and up to the observation deck. There was only about 10-15 other guests throughout the duration of our visit. The tourist element of this building is fascinating and the exhibition upon entry (past security), is well worth the time spent before rushing to get to the views.
The observation deck is exactly as seen on tv, films, etc and the views are spectacular.
This is an absolute must-do for any visitor to NYC.",5.0,4.645
2172,Empire State Building,We went during the beginning of the Pandemic when places were going into lock down.

2173,Too expensive,It was great. But you gotta stop selling high priced items. Photos are way out of price range as are the gifts. $35.99 for a photo book with 2 photos? LoL. Come on give me a break!

Sadly, the rating is reflective of the fact the staff were INCREDIBLY rude. Never have I ever experienced such poor manners from a fellow adult, and dare I say it, the polar opposite of my experience the same week with staff at Top of the Rock, who were incredibly nice, polite and informative.

2191,Empire State Building - Fantastic,"Visited early morning at 8.00. No queues at all (but presumably because of the start of coronavirus outbreak). Absolutely enormous building - I had no idea it was so grand. Very clever interactive sections that you go through before reaching the elevator to go up to viewing areas. Lots of history to read and interesting original detail regarding the building of Empire State Building. Loads of photo opportunities.

2197,Great way to see New York,"My wife & I had done the Empire State building several years ago. This time we went with our daughter. There have been a number of changes over the years since our last visit. There is now a more detailed exhibition explaining the history of the construction and there is a short animation in the elevator as you ascend to viewing platform. All of which now add to the experience. The viewing platform itself is largely unchanged and you still get a great view of lower Manhattan from the top.

The main criticism is the souvenir of photos taken on the way in, they weren't any good for our family and not worth buying. Also, there is no way to avoid the shop on the way out and most of it was very tacky touristy stuff, you had look for the special things that were worth buying.

It's certainly worth doing once in your lifetime.",4.0,2.2348

We were told if we bought the full x5 photos we would receive them for $36 instead of one for $12. On our way out we checked the photos and noticed there were only x2 of them, the other x3 you have to digitally download these and this was never informed to us.

2233,86th floor - Great Views,"This was the first thing I did on my NYC trip; Took the elevator to the 86th floor and took in the fantastic views of the city. And NYC really is a city for the views! The elevator ride is also smart - keeps you occupied. The March weather was quite cold - so jacket up suitably.

My tip: get the NYC pass - it covers the cost of these attractions well and gives you priority access.",4.0,4.7766
2234,Expensive. But it has to be done.,Been to NYC four times over 35 years. All four times included a trip to the Empire State Building. It is a better overall experience now than ever before. Just be prepared for a lofty ticket price.,4.0,4.1718
2235,Fantastic experience,This was our first trip to New York.Empire State Building was a must see for us.It was a fantastic experience.Couldnt believe how quick the lift took us up to 80th floor.There is so much to see inside the building as well as the stunning views all over the city.Great photo opportunities throughout the building.Well worth a visit.Staff are very pleasant and informative.,5.0,4.8742
2236,Great! That simple!,We were very lucky as there was not many people when we visited. We had bought our tickets beforehand as we read it can be very busy. We were in straight away. Everyone working there was lovely. Really cool museum Ms incredible sights. Totally worth it!,5.0,4.833
2237,First time,"Wow what a place, was lucky enough to get all the way to the 102 nd floor and it was well worth the ticket price. Visited in March was very quiet for our visit early March.",5.0,4.725
2238,Better than Expected,Hadn’t been to Empire State Building in more than 15 years and they have really updated the experience with a walk-through museum and much better crowd control. It was well done and our family enjoyed it. We went at 10:30am on a March weekday (spring break) and the crowds were really light.,5.0,4.6148
2239,Wow what a view,Paid to go to the top floor about £60 but didn’t prebook as weather was rainy and misty day before so paid at kiosk. We arrived at 9am to an empty building great time to go. Views were amazing especially top floor well worth the extra to go up. We did Rockerfeller as well Top of the Rock at sunset but this was far better in my opinion. Could stay as long as you wanted nice gift shop with different things it,5.0,4.9742
2240,Breathtaking,"Visited with my granddaughter and was not disappointed the views were breathtaking
Even though the ques were long the staff ushered everyone through quickly but was not rushed through the exexperience and left to enjoy the views",5.0,4.5902
2241,new Observation deck is awesome,"The new observation deck at the 102nd floor is awesome. It cost a lot, but it worth it. Had a lot of fun and it`s way better then the Observation deck of the One World Trade Center.",4.0,4.8434
2242,Very Enjoyable,"After purchasing tickets via trip advisor it was a quick process to enter the Empire and $10 cheaper than purchasing on the day. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit, excellent animation showing how the Empire was built. A visit is something you have to do when visiting New York. Very cold and windy at the top though!!",5.0,4.73
2243,Empire State Building,"Really enjoyed this. the pictures we got were amazing and not just the epic city views, there are several area for pictures even King Kong !! very informative, learned a lot. I want to add that everyone working on Monday 3/9 were friendly, helpful, and nice. I recommend this attraction.",5.0,4.941
2244,WOW !!!!!!,"Absolutely one of the most amazing places I have visited. Access was so easy, information about the history was great. Would have to say that Renita who greeted us on the 102nd floor was one of the most reassuring and friendly ladies I have ever met. We would come back just to see her again !!!",5.0,4.9394
2245,Native New Yorker Goes Touristy,"Grew up in NYC and like many native New Yorkers never visited many of the hyper touristy sites until out of town friends visited. Our friends wanted to visit the Empire State Building and midtown (we had tickets for an evening performance of West Side Story). I always purchase skip the line tickets for any venue when possible. So we walked right in no waiting. First we visited the second floor exhibit space. Too touristy! Exhibits mostly simple and designed for selfies/Instagram moments. Would like to have seen more detailed info on history, construction, engineering of the building etc. Fast elevator ride to 80th floor observation deck with skip the line pass. Great views on a super clear day. Outdoor heating is a plus. Need a few maps showing major sites for tourists traveling without a native guide. All in all a nice NY experience. PS skip the obligatory photo on the way in.",4.0,4.9418
2246,Exciting,"Even though I was advised not to go up, I did and loved it! The views by day are spectacular and you can perfectly see the height of the building by seeing people on the street like ants. Totally recommended!",5.0,4.8456
2247,I love the Empire State Building,"The new AV exhibits are fabulously immersive, The elevator one (look up) exciting. The King Kong very cute and fun. It was raining, limited visibility, it snowed on observation deck, who cares. The building is the greatest no matter the weather.",5.0,4.871
2248,Great Sights on a Beautiful Day,This is a little pricy with a teenager who isn’t interested in the history of the building. The museum part is excellent and engaging. The sights are breathtaking.,5.0,4.7914
2249,A classic! Even better than I remembered,"It's been over 15 years since i visited the ESB, and it did not disappoint! The new exhibits and updated observatory levels make this iconic building a must-do. The ESB staff were all super nice and answered any questions. I highly recommend going early, we went around 8:30am and it was not busy at all which was really great.. And the heaters on the 86th floor were great on a cold March morning! We paid the extra for the 102nd observatory level, which was really cool, but if you are on a tight budget, you'll see everything you want from the 86th floor. Make sure to download the audio guide, we enjoyed that part of it as well.",5.0,4.9306
2250,The best,The building was empty during world travel restrictions. Entry was immediate and there were no crowds during my visit. Got the best pictures!,5.0,3.719

2255,Totally worth it!,"One of the best attractions in NYC. I went there 20 years ago and it was really great to visit it again. It was a sunny Sunday in beginning of March, There were no cues, everything super easy and guided by friendly staff.",5.0,4.9437999999999995
2256,Even better than expected,"Visiting the ESB when being in New York is mandatory, though I expected an excruciating long waiting line. But when I came short before the opening in the morning on a labour day, I was granted access within a few minutes. The view was marvellous!",5.0,3.0
2257,Amazing!,"The Empire State Building has been completely redone since the last time we were there, and the renovation is simply amazing and well done! We went early, and there were no lines. This was quite an excellent experience. Everyone was beyond friendly, the elevators are extremely fast, and the place is immaculate!! Even the security machines are high tech!! I was more than impressed and fully understand the high ticket cost, which is beyond worth the $$. You will not be disappointed!!",5.0,4.9386
2258,Go in the day and at night,"A must visit, it is a great experience to do in the evening as well as the day. The museum is very interesting too",5.0,4.6958
2259,102nd floor,"Amazing building which was top of our list to visit whilst in NYC. There's plenty of history about the building as you make your way towards the elevators to take you to the 86th floor. Once on the 86th floor it's an open observation deck but it was really really windy and cold on our visit and busy.
We decided to pay the extra and go up to the 102nd floor which is encased with floor to ceiling windows and it wasn't busy at all.
We got some amazing photos of the surrounding city and spent as long as we wanted there.
If you're visiting NYC then this is a must visit.
Highly recommended.",5.0,4.7522

2262,Don’t miss the views!,"Don’t miss this iconic building or the breathtaking views from the top!

The journey up is full of information, picture opportunities and luxurious travel.

Beware - once hitting the 360’ observation deck the wind is SEVERE so make sure you’re wrapped up warm.

The views are spectacular and the atmosphere is electric.

Then, we were outside with marvellous views of the city and the river. Well worth it.",4.0,3.0516
2267,What an experience!,"For us more mature travellers, the Empire State was the tallest building in the world when we were kids, so for us it was the must see of the tall buildings in New York. We were not disappointed! Go early and you don’t have to queue for long. There’s a great museum with the history of the building, then you ascend to the viewing area, we didn’t go right to the top but the views were still amazing and we got some brilliant photos. Would thoroughly recommend.",5.0,4.9378
2268,Fascinating,"Great view and organized. The employees are very nice!
I bought the “all inclusive” photo package and it’s completely a scam!! You have to pay 36$ at the ESB for online access and afterwards 20$ online to get 1 photo!! I’m very disappointed",4.0,2.1722
2269,Manhattan at night,Visited with my adult daughter on a cold windy evening at the end of February. I last visited 9 years ago and it was definitely worth the return trip. Lovely staff and a good introduction area with photo opportunities. Heat lamps outside helped us enjoy the amazing lights of Manhattan at night.,4.0,4.9266000000000005
2270,Pricey but worth it. What an amazing view! The 102nd floor was amazing,"Completely redone since we'd last been there. The waiting line was short (10pm on a cold January weeknight), but the whole waiting line/area has been set up for interactive ""let's keep you busy."" The view was outstanding, the sax player at the top very good. They added overhead heating lamps that make a huge difference in the ability to enjoy the place.
We went up to the 102nd floor. It was an experience. I'd do it again.",5.0,4.9452

2276,Amazing skyline view,"What an incredible experience both inside the building and obviously the view.

We went at night, the sky was crystal clear and the lights of the City lit up the whole panorama - amazing.

We went as far as the 86th floor and for 6 of us balked at paying the additional $20 each to visit the 102nd floor - didn't see the need as the view from the 86th floor was good enough.

A must do visit.",4.0,4.7038
2277,The 102nd floor tour is worth it!,We went to see the sunset from the 102nd floor and it was glorious! There is a window from 4-8 and it was pricier that I thought it would be but it was completely worth it!,5.0,4.4322
2278,Iconic statue,Visited her in November. Weather was nice to allow for great visibility from shore and on ferry over to island. The feeling you get from seeing this statue can not be described. Its a must see. Its so well kept it looks new. Airport style security to get on to ferry to take you over which is no problem and a good idea. Waiting time for us was good. Beware of the rogue sellers stopping you to try and sell you tickets you dont need. These people are not genuine ticket sellers. You do not require fast pass etc. As they tey to tell you. If in New York for the first time this is a must see.,5.0,4.8584
2279,Must seen experience,One of the must seen places in Manhattan. From the top you will be able to see almost every place in NYC. take some nice photos and may be stopping by the gift shop for 1 or 2 souvenirs.

Clear signs & lots of interesting information to read whilst making your way to viewing floors.

2290,Would’ve been 5* if it wasn’t for a very rude staff member!,"So yesterday me, my partner and his mum visited the Empire State Building. I have to say we all thought it was excellent overall from the exhibitions to the view itself.

We arrived as the sun was setting and seeing the city change from night to day and begin to light up was amazing.

The new renovation is also very good and very interesting and overall the staff were very polite and very friendly.

The whole thing was the best experience until the end. This happened on 4th March 2020 at around 18:45 if management would like to investigate who was on shift.

Whilst waiting in the queue for service in the gift shop by the exit we thought that a staff member was assisting another with the till as she didn’t call us and was speaking with her. Following this we were rudely shouted at by her “next customer! I did scream it at you like 3 times” taken aback I initially approached the till and then she had the audacity to suck her teeth at me.

With that I told her how rude she was and that I didn’t want to be served by her and that I’d like to see a manager or supervisor. I was told that the manager “was off” and that if I “had a problem I should call the number on the receipt”. I insisted further and was told she was in fact IN and had “just gone upstairs for her one hour lunch break” so I demanded that I see the manager to no avail. None of the staff around would assist me in calling them. Imagine if it had been an emergency and the manager had “gone on a one hour lunch” I’m certain they’d have been called then.

Anyways this well presented and frankly glamorous looking lady named Derianne quite clearly didn’t have an attitude to match her appearance and let down the whole team.

A kind member of staff, who’s name I can’t remember, apologised to me because he saw the whole thing which I appreciated, at the same time Derianne walked around the corner and through a staff only door to avoid the situation and avoid an apology.

I used to work in the Spinnaker Tower in Portsmouth, UK - part of the World Federation of Great Towers along with the Empire State - and know how people should be treated in these places where experience is of the utmost importance.

She needs to either get a new job away from people or change her attitude and realise you don’t speak to people like that in general, let alone at the most famous building in the world where people pay a lot of money to visit!

She soured our experience but apart from Derianne this place is a must. I just hope more people aren’t treated the same way by her. Shouting and sucking your teeth at people is degrading and disrespectful.",3.0,4.8808
2291,Amazing,4 ladies between the ages of 29-54 and we all loved it! It was nothing like any of us expected it was so much more. From the staff to the views we had the most funny amazing time and will 100% be back!,5.0,4.7842

2294,Worth a visit,"I'd been told that I would have to queue for ages to get into the Empire State Building, but there were no queues at all when I arrived on a Tuesday morning. The process was very smooth and the exhibition prior to ascending the lift interesting.

The view from the observation deck was great and it wasn't too crowded. I didn't pay the extra to go to the very top, and to be honest didn't feel any need to - I was happy with the view I got.",4.0,4.9364
2295,Iconic Views,"Visited the ESB late afternoon, to see the NYC views in both daylight and sunset. As we visited late February, there were no lines for tickets, walked straight in purchased tickets and cleared security all within 10 minutes. I can't say anything about the building or views that hasn't been said or written about countless times before, but suffice to say, it's the ultimate tourist thing to do, so it's got to be done when in New York! A special mention and thank you to Sharon B, who went above and beyond to help us on our visit.",5.0,4.816
2296,Not just a pretty view!,"I expected to take an elevator to a viewpoint over Manhattan. Yes, this happened, but I also got an immersive journey through the creation and prominence of this iconic landmark and symbol of New York. The experience of builders, portrayers, star visitors and movie-makers bring the experience to life in a very satisfying way. Uniformed, elegant doormen and ushers are polite and gracious, bringing to mind an earlier, privileged time. The Art display in the downstairs lobby was also a highlight for me.

Less positive points:
- Only 2 female toilets. Not enough for such amount of people that the observatory can acommodate;
- They take you a picture at the entrance for you to purchase if you want to. The amount that is charged is almost another ticket to get in the building, which I find it ridiculous. A photo is supposed to be a capture of that special moment and space and should be charged less than half of the entrance ticket's price (which already is expensive).",4.0,4.8995999999999995

2324,Great views,We enjoyed the museum and the great views from the 86th floor. The staff was very organized around the elevators to keep everything moving smoothly.,4.0,4.6251999999999995

2326,Amazing Experience,the overall experience was amazing. The view was stunning especially from the 102nd floor and every single employee was so wonderful and helpful. they were all so kind and so willing to help and point out every attraction of the city. it was so worth visiting and learning about the amazing landmark that is the Empire State Building!,5.0,4.9708000000000006
2327,takes your breath away,"From the moment I stepped into the ESB I felt goose bumps. I really enjoyed reading about the history and looking at all the pictures and displays. Seeing King Kong make an appearance was certainly one of the hightlights. I thought it was worth going to both the 86th and 102nd floor. I have gone to the ""Top of the Rock"" on a different trip and you get a different experience from both. If you have time can afford it I would do both, one during the day and one at night.",5.0,4.6536
2328,Empire state building day and night combo,Went early doors 08:10...no queues so straight in.....plenty of exhibits to be seen with plenty of photo opportunities.

If you pre book have a look at the weather forecast in advance to avoid disappointment.,5.0,1.8826
2329,Excellent trip up the Empire State Building,"We arrived at our pre-booked time of 08:00 a.m. on a grey and damp day in New York, we were promptly advised that the the gloom at street level meant no view at the top of the tower. With the weather forecast to remain for the day, we were disappointed that we would not be able to enjoy our planned visit, so it was great to learn that we could use our ticket to return the following day... or any day during our time in New York... when the weather was better.

We were completely unaware of this fact when purchasing our tickets online and it was only down to the kind staff at the Empire State Building that we were able to enjoy the amazing views over Manhattan and beyond the following morning.

It was great to spend a good deal of time at both the 86th and 102nd floors, the views over New York are incredible and the staff that we encountered were pleasant and helpful. We would certainly recommend a visit to anyone considering the Empire State Building.",5.0,4.9672

In February it's freezing and really windy. You've been warned!

If you go shortly before sunset and hang around for a while, you'll get both day and night views - that's my recommendation.",4.0,2.2194000000000003
2335,"A ""must-do"" trip","We booked the 86 & 102nd floor package with fast-pass.
Didn't actually need the fast-pass as it turned out to be a quiet Monday in February hey-ho.
Glad we did the 102nd floor add-on, but while we would 100% visit again, we wouldn't do that part next time - the view was no different really - but if we'd not gone up we'd have always wondered what we were missing!
Staff made a fuss of our daughter as it was her 21st, they were great!",5.0,3.856

Certainly worth seeing, as is the ceiling of the lift when going from the ground floor to the 80th. I really liked the King Kong addition.

The views are amazing from the 87th and they’re outdoors, but the 102 brings it to a new level, while remaining indoors with floor to ceiling windows. Gordon, the 102nd floor guide was super knowledge and friendly. It didn’t seem overly crowded at any time and we definitely enjoyed our visit.",5.0,4.9504

We visited on the Tuesday evening in time for dusk but the very helpful staff were honest and said that it would appear foggy at the top as it was cloudy but we could reuse our tickets the following day.
We returned on Wednesday and went to the top for the stunning views of NYC at sunset absolutely breathtaking.
It does get a little busy at this time and it was cold but they have put up heaters outside
Thoroughly enjoyed our visit and something we will remember forever.
It’s unbelievable that this stunning Art Deco building is nearly 90 years old !!",5.0,4.9742
2352,Do not miss this,This was the highlight of our trip. All staff wear 1930s style outfits and are very friendly and helpful. If you like history this is a must see. You get a great understanding of the workforce who built it and the nature of their work. There are numerous photo opportunities and the views from the top are some of the best in New York. I would recommend going up to the top floor 102 where the view is even better. Do not miss a visit here,5.0,4.9662

The Empire State building was probably my highlight (of many) of the week from the welcoming staff, the history, the fantastic elevator journey to the observation deck, King Kong and then those views, wow!! Thank you Empire State and thank you NYC.",5.0,4.9074
2357,Disappointing,"I chose to do this one misty rainy evening, not even thinking about the visibility from the top. I almost purchased a double entry ticket but glad I didn't. With a fear of heights the elevator was tough but on getting out at the top I discovered that visibility was virtually zero. Only the lights of buildings very close could be vaguely seen, if one looked down carefully. Going outside very scared, I quickly returned as there was no point in staying out there. I couldn't see anything. I am shocked that on occasions like this visibility is not made known, or ticket prices are discounted. The displays one has to go through at the bottom were interesting but it was a lot of money to pay just for that. Very disappointed.",3.0,3.3866

2362,Top of the Rock just before snowfall.,"A classic stop for great views of the city and the Hudson. A little pricy though to ride an elevator though all for the sake of the view.

2363,Marvellous view,"We had clear sky, so excellent view! Nice animation in the elevator.
Tot go to floor 102 too expensive for family of 6☹️",4.0,4.747
2364,"A must if you haven’t been, but $$$","Tickets to go to the newly opened 102nd floor were $77 per person! We choked on that but decided to go anyway, and have a cheap dinner that night. They have a decent museum to walk through as you make your way to the elevators. It’s interesting, has some fun interactive exhibits. First stop is the 86th floor where you can walk outside. They have heaters on in the winter which was a nice touch. The views are great from here so if you only pay to get here you will be happy. I believe its $50 to only go to this floor. If you paid the extra to go up to the 102nd floor you can do that from here. The 102 floor is floor to ceiling glass, with similar views, just higher. So, all in all, if you haven’t been, go for it. But it’s kind of a racket at that price. Oh, and ignore the ticket hawkers who try to tell you the wait is over an hour. Go in and ask the receptionist about wait times. We went on a Friday afternoon and there was no wait. Entrance is on 34th street.",4.0,4.8696
2365,"First Time, It was good","We went on a Sunday and surprisingly there was NO line. I heard you can stand in line for 45mins to an hour. Staff are very helpful. Tickets was $45 each. If you plan to visit NYC and want to do more than 3 attractions, I recommend purchasing the city pass. you'll save money that way. The security process is kinda like the airports TSA. Basically everything off onto the bin, only thing is you can keep your shoes on. NO Glass bottles are allowed. You'll walk through the exhibit with lots of displays for you to take photos, read and watch. Then you'll proceed to the elevator which take you up to the 80th floor. While in the elevator it'll show you a small imax video of the process of building the empire. On the 80th floor you get the view of the entire city. You have an option to go outside for a better view too. They do have heated lamps all around to keep you warm during winter. To go up to the highest floor 102. its an additional cost. For me 80th was good enough. I'm sure its the same view. The experience was ok. I wouldn't pay to go again. Not worth the money.",4.0,4.9382
2366,What a view,I wasn’t brave enough to go to the top but my friends were.. beautiful Art Deco building... it took 1 year and 45 days to build. Interactive screens all around so you can learn about the building. Helpful friendly staff.. open till 2am in the morning from 8am. There is a gift shop and interactive King King a must do,5.0,4.955

Views were obviously incredible, we were glad we waited until our last day to visit as we were already familiar with NY we could spot recognisable places. Unforgettable experience which I would highly recommend!",5.0,4.7656
2372,"Nice, but overpriced for what it is.","We visited the Empire State Building at the end of February. There were no queues, which was great. We bought ‘normal’ tickets to go up to the 102nd floor. We were quite shocked by the price of $307 for two adults, one teenager and a child. Outrageous! We went up and had a good time.

The ‘route’ through the building beautifully decorated in Art Deco style and now several exhibitions, some interactive, to tell you the story of the building. The view of central park is somewhat obscured by the new buildings rising up in front of it which is a shame. The pm visit is really special. It costs a small fortune but it’s a one off.

Took in all the angles and vistas and could not get over the engineering needed to complete the vision.
Really a pleasant experience on the 102nd observation area with a remarkable lady employee who made it special. She charmed everyone with he knowledge of everything, had the classic NY accent and of course a charmer.

It's pretty bad that they have you take your pic with a green screen ahead of time to get a picture of you and the NY skyline without the bars and the heat lamps.... and of course if you want it, that will cost extra.

However we forgot about it at evenings end. Wished there was some reminders posted to pick up belongings if need be. Maybe a reminder in the elevator. He is missing his knife as there was. I tune to go back to the building before we left the next morning from NY.,4.0,4.1438
2413,Great!,"Great!Enter in the morning-you will avoid waiting in the long line.Make sure you choose nice sunny day for visit,so you can enjoy the views.Security staff and staff around-very friendly.",5.0,4.816
2414,Empire state observation platform,"Absolutely incredible views. Gets very busy and crowed around 11am.
We had a new york pass, which included this visit upto the 86th floor. Unfortunately the upgrade to the 102nd floor was $35.00 each extra.",4.0,2.32
2415,Empire,"Amazing, very cool with children. Love the King Kong area. Very well organised, better to go early otherwise the queues are long. A little bit expensive.",4.0,4.8892
2416,Amazing Sunrise Experience!,"We had perfect weather to view the sunrise over the city. They limit the number of people who can go up, so it's not too crowded. We were lucky enough to witness a marriage proposal (she said YES!). As people began to leave, we felt like we had the whole building to ourselves. We went down to the 86th floor and it was magic! Thoroughly enjoyed the 2nd floor museum and King Kong as well.",5.0,4.8738
2417,Awsome experience,"My wife and I decided to visit the Empire State Building at night as we visited in daylight on a previous holiday, I can honestly say I was blown away with the views at night from every angle, I could have happily spent a long time just taking in the views, I'd certainly recommend a visit to anyone visiting New York and if possible at night as its simply stunning",5.0,4.8826
2418,Iconic!,"Visited in February 2020 using a Go City New York Pass. Arrived early around 9 am and we had no queues. Loved looking at all the history on the way up, the celebrity photos of who has visited and King Kong. The views are phenomenal.",5.0,3.8038
2419,Amazing!,"Great time, great views. Would recommend paying for express or VIP, Well worth the money otherwise expect to wait in long lines",5.0,4.9134
2420,WOW,Visit in 2002. Amazing breath taking views! Would love to see it again. Planning holidays already. All see you soon,5.0,4.7954
2421,Attraction not to be missed,We had such a great time and enjoyed the view of New York from the 86th Floor. Really enjoyed following the timeline layout of the buildings construction. Learnt so much. The money spent was well worth it,5.0,4.8574
2422,Amazing experience,We arrived in New York city and headed straight to the Empire state building and started our trip going up to the top of this amazing building. Amazing breath taking views!! We did it by night and it was great!! Thank you!!,5.0,4.9176
2423,Wowwwwww,"Took in the sights on the 86th floor one word is stunning. We then paid a small fee and went to the 102nd floor ... absolutely unbleivable ... you are outside during your visit so amazing views ... N, E, S, & W to the 85 &102 floor so in the winter wrap up.",5.0,4.632
2424,Great views from a fantastic building!!,Glad we waited till nightime when the queues were non existent. Plenty of time & space to view the whole of New York at night. Got some fantastic photos,5.0,4.53
2425,Breathtaking!,"The Empire State Building had all the glamour I had imagined ever since childhood and some great modern features! The museum was fantastic, and the sunset view was breathtaking! Definitely a place to visit and re-visit!",5.0,4.9128
2426,Great experience,"When booking tickets for the Empire State Building I upgraded to the VIP package which included the express line and access to the 102 floor. Always a risk as you don’t know how busy it will be but luckily on this occasion the queues were huge and the risk paid off. Fantastic views from the top, we were lucky as we had a clear day. Also worth seeing it during the evening, New York looks stunning lit up. All in all a wonderful experience.",5.0,4.9716000000000005
2427,First Class experience from A to Z !!!! highly recommend - a must see!,"Just Awesome -- every inch of the experience. great for all ages, great even if you have been years ago.",5.0,4.8462
2428,Empire State Building,"I recoomend booking the VIP tickets, it can get extremely busy and there are wait times for the lifts both up and down. With the VIP you are straight up and straight down.",5.0,4.7942
2429,My favorite place,"When I have the opportunity of visiting NYC, take some time for enjoying the view and all the history that the Empire State Building gave us",5.0,4.4702
2430,Valentine’s at the Empire,"Beautiful! I went for Valentine’s day with my husband and it was marvellous. It was really windy because of the season, but we enjoyed the view and we learned a lot at the museum",5.0,4.6032
2431,Absolutely brilliant!!,"The experience we had up the Empire state building was one to treasure for a lifetime. I would definitely go back, no matter what it would cost!!👍👍👌😀😀🙂",5.0,4.0484
2432,This was one of the highlights of our holiday,Didn’t think this would be a great day but I was very wrong. Thoroughly enjoyed all of the information and history about the building and films that have been made in the Empire State Building. This visit took just over 3 hours as we went all the way to floor 102. Floor 86 gives just as good a view for a significantly smaller price. This is a must visit for NYC,5.0,4.1426
2433,Toilets out of service,"The toilets at the 86th floor observatory were out of service. We asked the staff memebers and they kept us going down the building until we find ourselves at the street with a big urgency to use a toilet.

We came inside again asking to use a toilet but they refused even with an explanation of what have happened. Of course we had our entrance ticket but it has been used alreday so they denied the service.

Please train the staff members so they can give celar instructions on how to find a working toilet and it wuould be nice to let visitors with a valid ticket to use them.",2.0,2.7856
2434,Awesome,"Such an amazing reflection of what NY is all about. Perfection in every way
The Empire State Building is a true depiction of NY",5.0,4.7668
2435,Fabulous,"Booked online the evening before and arrived about 9.30 am with my 5 year old granddaughter. 4th visit to NY but 1st time to the Empire State. Absolutely loved it, I was prepared for long queues but it was quite quiet. Great exhibitions inside that were really interesting. Lovely weather too so we could see for miles. Yes you have to exit through the gift shop but the products were good quality and the staff were really friendly and helpful. Well worth going.",5.0,4.989
2436,Poor customer service with regards to refund,"Booked tickets for the family to go up in the Empire States Building, but, much to our son’s disappointment had to cancel our trip to New York and as such requested a refund on the tickets. We also requested refunds for trips booked to The Statue of Liberty, MOMA and other tours. All of our refund requests were answered promptly and professionally and the money refunded. I have written to the Empire State Building customer service enquiries twice now and still have received no reply. Astoundingly poor service for such a prominent tourist destination.",1.0,2.408
2437,Sunset at the top of NYC,Recommend the full tour of the building. Floor 102 is worth the extra money. Nice floor to ceiling windows. Especially if you are going at sunset or sunrise.,5.0,4.4702
2438,Superb views,"Spent a good couple of hours plus of a 3 day trip to THe Big Apple on a trip to see this iconic building. Was amazed at the wealth of information about the building, the films it's featured in, the vistors its had, not to mention the construction of it on the first two or three floors before you get into the lift upto the 80th floor and the first chance to look over the city. THen you go upto the 86th floor and the outside viewing gallery. We were there on a clear crisp, windy day, the external heaters were a very good addition. Stunning views all over the city. If we had another hour to spare we would have gone up again to the 126th floor, but we had too much to see in too short a time.",5.0,4.7062
2439,Excellent and Enjoyable!,"After visiting other major sites in the city, by far is the most efficient and effective process making it the most enjoyable! The staff was wonderful! Going through security was so streamlined and efficient! Every part of your journey was easygoing because the staff had people moving in the right direction! Once you make it to the level you paid for in your ticket price, you have plenty of time to move around freely and take your pictures. It truly was stress free and line free! Thank you!",5.0,4.9732
2440,Engaged,Great trip! Amazing history of the Empire State Building. Great Atmosphere and to top it off asked my now Fiance to marry me on the 86th floor. She said YES! State Bar and Grille was also amazing! 5/5 and highly recommend all around.,5.0,4.9538
2441,It was freezing cold so no wait :-),"We went on a Friday night and since it was so cold, there weren’t many people there. This meant no wait for any of it. We really enjoyed the walk thru area to see the history of the ESB. Beautiful place!",5.0,4.5278
2442,Special place,Well what can I say 1st time in New York for both my partner and myself and the Empire State will forever be special to us as this is where my partner proposed to me at the top overlooking all of New York. Amazing views and enjoyed all of the information along the way to the top. It was super busy but that is to be expected as it is a main attraction but still did not wait too long and the option was there to use stairs along the way. Will be going back at some point hopefully sooner rather than later.,5.0,4.8994
2443,Empire State Building visit.,"We visited the Empire state building last week on our family holiday to New York. We have 2 young children aged 7 & 9.
Overall the visit was good with great views over the city and we caught it right on sunset which made it that bit better.
The decor of the building was disappointing as we were hoping to see the art deco corridors & entrances but unfortunately you only see a snippet of these when you finally leave the building.
The staff working there operating the lifts & guiding people around were less than helpful & somewhat rude when we asked for directions to find the lift to the 102 floor, one customer asked about using the stairs to go down 6 floors to a lift & was sworn at by the member of staff on the door.
It was good to visit but we won't be recommending here or rushing back.",3.0,4.4818
2444,Excellent Iconic Building in NY,"We visited the Empire State Building in the morning. We had pre-purchased tickets with a City Pass, but hadn’t booked a time slot. We were able to walk straight through, with very little queuing.
View from the top is fantastic, and the museum you pass through on your way to the lifts tell the story of how the building was built.",5.0,4.7146
2445,Amazing place,"Wonderful to visit, wonderful to know about its history. The King Kong experience is amazing and very life like. The elevator is the quickest I've ever been in...haha but anyway, great to see how tiny we are on such a high place. Beautiful to go around and see the city.",5.0,4.9274000000000004
2446,Great visit,Although a bit of a cloudy day well worth the visit the views for logn distant were limited and the view from the 102 floor worth the effort,5.0,3.9176
2447,Excellent way to see the city skyscape - best to go at Dusk,"bought tickets for the 80th and 86th floor from Concierge service in hotel which enabled us to skip the line for tickets. We went about 5pm on a Friday night in February and there was no queue. we were able to pass through security and get the elevator to the 80th floor inside 5 mins and then explored the very interesting 80th floor before heading up to the 86th floor and the outdoor viewing area. We were there at dusk so managed to catch the setting sun in the background and the lights of the city coming on. the crowds were well controlled, although there was a 40 min wait for the elevator down from the 86th to the 80th floor so they eventually opened up the stairwell to the 80th. Overall a positive experience",5.0,4.6714
2448,Dissapointed - dont buy the photo package it is a rip off,"The visit to the Empire state building in itself was worth it for the views, the history and the lovely architecture.
However the queues were horrendous, and the staff were very jaded and overwhelmed.
We did the tourist thing and had our photo taken and when we were leaving went to collect it.
We were told that we received two copies of one print and could download other pictures with different backgrounds online for an additional fee.
We paid this as I wanted to email pics to friends.
However when I logged online I received the message that my ID number did not exist.
I emailed the company who manages this for the Empire State Building (Showtime Pictures) and they did not respond.
I emailed again and after a month got a generic response asking for more information.
I provided this and have emailed another two times and have received no response.
Pathetic Customer Service and an absolute rip off.
Showtime Pictures you should be ashamed of your lack of Customer service and Empire State Building do you know what is happening with your support staff and suppliers?
Very disappointing indeed.",3.0,1.302
2449,A must do when visiting NY,"This view never gets old. I've visited the ESB a few times now and it always puts on a good show, especially at night. Our only disappointment was that we wanted to upgrade our ticket to go right to the top but as it was after 10pm there was no staff available to exchange our ticket (we had a NY Pass). It was still very busy even though it was later in the evening. Leave plenty of time as you have to go through security which takes time as you have to remove belts, jackets etc. The museum exhibit is very interesting and King Kong is a fun addition.",5.0,4.7276
2450,Iconic view,Breathtaking views of NYC. Only issue is that it difficult to get a nice photo as people tend to walk past all the time.,5.0,4.0212
2451,Spectacular!,The views were great. The history of construction was very interesting. Who doesn't love King Kong who made the place very well known and desirable.,4.0,4.627
2452,Going Ape Up the Empire State,"Visited the Empire State building for the second time in three years but still wasn't disappointed with the experience as they've since added a different entrance way which now takes you up to the lifts via a series of exhibits and film/TV memorabilia etc.

There are a few ""fun"" interactive elements such as posing with King Kong holding you in his fist and a large screen showing several different images of the building that you can stand in front of and have your picture taken.

Overall well worth a visit if you've not been before as it's one of those iconic ""been there"" places.",5.0,4.618
2453,Amazing view of New York!,Walk around the outside at the top of the Empire State Building for a clear view of the city! See photo;s of all the movies been filmed there : Huge King Kong.,5.0,4.4354
2454,Very pricey but worth going up to Level 102,"Get there early to avoid the crowds. If you do that it’s not worth paying the extra to jump the lines.
The views from 102 are stunning on a clear day.
Worth getting to walk the city first before you go here so you know what you are looking at?",5.0,3.9994
2455,Wonderful experience!,No queues as arrived about 8.45. Lots to see and read before you arrive at the top. Brilliant time and well worth a visit.,5.0,4.5012
2456,Great view even from regular platform,"I enjoyed the view from the 87th floor a lot. The Empire State Building is always worth a visit when the weather plays its part and there are no clouds in the way. The reason I am giving 4 out of 5 points is that they ask a premium for the even higher floors. I don’t think that the view from up there is better than from the regular platform, so I went for the regular ticket and I had a great experience. I can recommend it to anyone visiting New York.",4.0,4.8846
2457,A Magical Experience...,Until you reach the top you really don`t appreciate the views of the city. The views were awesome and its a memory I`ll never forget x,4.0,4.7278
2458,A must-do in New York,"Great experience, we booked tickets online the day before and turned up about 8.30, went through without any queues, the views are stunning, and staff all courteous and friendly. All in all a wonderful thing to do.",5.0,4.9018
2459,WOOOOOW!! No more words!,"The best experience! If you go during the night is magic! I recommend take the elevator to the floor 102, awesome view of Manhattan!",5.0,4.8262
2460,Holiday,"Very good, just did the ferry tour, the skies were clear so the views were spectacular. It was good value for money as it was included in the city bus tour ticket. Took about 80 minutes, included statue of liberty, Ellis Island and brooklyn Bridge. Manhatten and Jersey coast line. Excellent commentary throughout",4.0,4.9102
2461,102nd Floor at The Empire State - Wow,"We had an amazing visit to The Empire State Building - Fantastic Clear Skies gave amazing views - visiting the 102nd Floor for the first time added an extra buzz - Priority Access worth every penny - Outstanding Visit, highly recommended",5.0,4.9348
2462,Beautifully stunning building,We had already been to the Rockerfella so wasn’t sure if we would make it but so glad we did. The style of the building is mesmerising. It was super organised with no queue and an interesting exhibition. Would highly recommend.,5.0,4.9152000000000005
2463,Great experience,"We absolutely loved the whole experience. Steeped in history, people who work there clearly care about the experience their customers get. Breathtaking views.
If you do nothing else in NYC, do this ❤️",5.0,4.84
2464,NYC trip Feb’ 2020,"No queue, blue sky, friendly crew. Amazing and beautiful view in NYC, fantastic. We bought the ticket online prior to the visit, very easy and fast and secured. Stop at floor #80, then up to #86. It goes then down to ground floor in less than a minute. All in all it’s a bit more than an hour at that period of the year. Check the weather before buying the ticket, no sense to go if you don’t have a clear sky. A must-do in NYC.",5.0,4.909
2465,Organization,"I was so impressed with the associates' organization, all was very well coordinated from the person in the main entrance to the person in floor 102.
Highly recommended!",5.0,4.6008
2466,Love the history and architecture,"While a tiny bit pricey the trip into the Empire State Building is just such an iconic event. For anyone who has studied American History this is just cool. Our visit was cold and windy but who cares, this is just a wonderful experience in a beautiful piece of Americana.",5.0,4.904
2467,Very Well Organised,"Very well organised, brilliant views and it’s a must if you go to New York. The King Kong section was great. 1st you go you the 80th floor then 86th. You can go higher but you need to upgrade ticket. Go early aswell because there’s hardly any queues",5.0,4.3966
2468,Brilliant,Lovely place to stop at whilst in New York. Without a doubt you must go. I had the pleasure to go at night and the views were just breathtaking and so so stunning,5.0,4.868
2469,Well worth it,Organised and interesting. The museum is great and informative. The whole system of getting to the viewing platform is great. We didn’t experience any queues and didn’t have the special fast track one either.,4.0,4.8548
2470,First NYC Trip!,Really enjoyed visiting ESB!! It was so interesting to see how the building was constructed so many years ago! Can’t wait to go back and visit again!,5.0,4.7002
2471,Just wow!,"It had been a clear day so we made an impulsive decision to go up as we knew we would have stunning views. We went up 30 minutes before the sun started to set, so had the day, dusk and night views and they were amazing. The 86th floor was busy, 3 deep with people on the 'sunset' side of the building. We had tickets to the 102nd floor - so worth the extra money. It was calm and peaceful up there, no crowds and you could take as long as you liked. It is expensive, but for and my two teenage children it was a real trip highlight!",5.0,4.808
2472,Amazing views,"The guy in the ticket desk should have advised us the required time to go up (required time for elevators),enjoy views and go back to start the guided tour... We didn't reach it",4.0,2.9618
2473,"Beautiful, an excellent views around",Love it there and wanted to go back there again in the future. We love where King Kong and other famous were there at the time was filming. We find it very interested though.,5.0,4.816
2474,Empire State Building,"I visited the Empire State building on a sunny clear day and boy...the views did not disappoint! The queue was fairly long to get in, but it moved pretty quick. I liked that you could spend as much time at the top as you wanted. It was busy at the top but easy to find spaces to look out and take photos.",5.0,4.9264
2475,My favourite trip in NYC,"Can't recommend this enough. It had just the right balance of tourism (e.g being able to have a photo taken) and interesting facts about the building & its construction. And then of course there are spectacular views. I went during the day & it was great but might be even better at night.

I went as part of a NYC pass which meant I had access to floor 80 & 86 but not 102 as this cost an extra amount. I don't know if it's worth the extra as the views were already fantastic.",5.0,4.7791999999999994
2476,$235 for three people!!!!,"Iconic - but exploitive. Not like Sleepless in Seattle where they hop up in the lift!!. You battle your way up through a carnival of tat. Pricing misleading - research in advance. Or go up the world trade centre observatory instead - higher, clearer and half the price.",3.0,1.2388
2477,Sunset Visit to the Empire State Building,"Arrived at the building about 45 minutes before sunset, made it to the top with plenty of time to see the city in daylight and then with sun setting. Then as darkness falls you see the city light up.
Wonderful views all round, not surprising that the sunset side got crammed at that time though.
Well worth it, so much to see from this one vantage point.",5.0,4.3788
2478,Amazing!,Would definitely visit again. I had no waiting time in line so got to the top very quickly view of NYC at night was amazing and would love to see it during the day.,5.0,4.7668
2479,Breath taking views,Didn’t visit on my first trip to NYC- what a mistake. No long queues and the views were amazing. Right at the top you can see for miles. Definitely worth a visit.,5.0,4.3616
2480,Fantastic view,"Was there while my winter business trip in the evening. NY night view is fantastic, there was open space where you can take great pictures and they set UFO, so even so high its quite comfortable and warm, nothing distract you from the city viewing. And it's not so popular as WTC observatory, so not too many tourists visit it these days.",5.0,4.8166

2487,Not worth $80USD for a adult and child,No longer ICONIC - it is just another money spinner. Pity. I have always viewed the Empire State Building as one of the greatest buildings. Everything you see is pretty much remade or new visual.,2.0,4.2248
2488,An absolute must see experience!,"Absolutely loved visiting the Empire State Building. We opted to purchase the ultimate ticket which gave us access to the 2nd floor museum, the 86th floor, and the 102nd floor. Best decision ever!

The history and extraordinary detail that went into this building left me speechless. The views were breathtaking, the observation decks - uhhhMazing! I found myself standing in awe of the magnificent architecture surrounding me.

I could have stayed all day. #EmpireStateBuilding",5.0,4.9014
2489,An essential experience but you have to time it just right,It's iconic and a must-do part of your first visit to New York. We were fortunate and got up during a quieter moment. The queues were OK and the crowds were not too thick at the top. Avoid it during the busy times as it quickly becomes a bit too overwhelming.,4.0,4.3266
2490,Excellent,"Very much enjoyed this visit. This was my 3rd trip over the years to the Empire State but my son's first - we were in New York for his 18th birthday.

2494,Go to the new viewing platform,"IMHO pay the extra to get access to the new upper viewing platform. My wife and I went at night, wasn’t busy and views were spectacular. I had been before but the new additions including the King Kong area on the way up to the 86 floor are a great improvement to this attraction. Well worth the money 👍🏻👍🏻",5.0,4.8873999999999995

2496,Better than ever!,"I visited the building in 2015 and it was great, but this time it was even better! So many interactive rooms before you even make it up to the top. So much fun. Was a very special visit, and felt first class.",5.0,4.9136
2497,A Night Time Highlight!,"We definitely feel we saved the best until last with our tour of the Empire state building at night which we had booked as part of a pass and as a must see attraction. It really was such a special end to not only an amazing trip but an unforgettable birthday day.

The museum part was fascinating and all the culture and history you get to soak up and interact with was awesome- the views you can see as you get higher were incredible. All of the staff were so friendly and welcoming and it enhanced the experience even more so when one of them sang a rendition of Happy Birthday to me in front of everyone and they all clapped and cheered made me feel overwhelmed with joy.

When we got to the very top it was unreal the views were simply breathtaking and although it was cold and windy it was a perfectly clear night to take in the city's rooftops and all the lights for miles around. You can do a complete 360 degree turn of the building and get a totally different stance and viewpoint which makes for the most epic and memorable photos!",5.0,4.9925999999999995

2504,"Live experience, high view",I was impressed with how there were many animations and history before going to the top. Good quality and subtil choices of pictures/videos.,4.0,4.5565999999999995
2505,Great Experience in NYC,"Empire State Building was a great experience, security was busy and tight as expected.
The whole experience was amazing, from the history of how it was built through to famous films featuring the iconic building......then you have the views, just breathtaking and we were lucky enough to have clear blue sky's.",5.0,4.913
2506,Best views,"The best unobstructed views from the open air observatory, with a well structured educational museum.",5.0,4.486
2507,Breathtaking views,It was a clear night so we decided at the spur of the moment to go up. It was easy and quick to get our tickets and to get up the elevators. We purchased the extra ticket to go up to the 102nd floor - which was an amazing experience. There are lot of exhibits and photos and photo ops before you even get to the observatory floors. Definitely a must do!,5.0,4.812
2508,Best of all attractions,"Best trip of all attractions in my opinion.
The gift shop isn’t really too bad in price when you think you get the official merchandise and the shops outside on the street more or less charge the same if not more in some case.

I call my wife the Marketers dream, because when I walked in and noticed they were taking photos I immediately knew she would buy it even when I accidentally closed my eyes.
This was $26, the Rock charges $29. She falls for it every time.

Anyway my only criticism is when you are at the top as with many of the buildings it would be nice to have some sort of key telling you most of the land marks, some are obvious and you can work out for yourself but other buildings you don’t have a clue.
The Rock has an app you can use with a view finder which is free to download but a bit basic. You can download it and use before you leave the country and check it out. But overall I think the Empire State is better, maybe because it was the first one we went up when we arrived and then when you go up all the others they are pretty much the same, but empire has the edge because it’s more iconic.

By the way , we used the New York Go explorer pass and we didn’t have to wait, We went straight up there , no queuing in a separate line for your tickets then going into another queue. They just scanned our ticket and we went right to the top.",5.0,4.8988
2509,Don't miss it!!!!,"I had visited the Empire State in 2004 before the comprehensive renovation and I remembered a dark and old interior, sadly iluminated, a dull starcaise lacking af any interest for the visitor, who was guided directly to the top. The latest visit was a 360degrees visit, an amazing immersion for all ages.
Highly recommended!",5.0,4.5138

2530,Love visiting the Empire State Building,"I really enjoy visiting the building and it has breath taking views.
I like the layout of the new exhibition before going up top. However, I do miss going through the old entrance, and last time we went we were aloud up twice in one day. One and daylight and a night time visit. This time we were only aloud the once.",4.0,4.4692

2539,Such views!,"We went on a clear mild winter day and could see so far, and it was just beautiful!!!!
We didn't have to wait to buy tickets with this purchase but we also weren't eligible to just skip the line. It was easy to do, and if you don't have to find the line, and wait on the line to buy the tickets, it is always worth it. I highly recommend you go early!!!!! Thinking of going back at night someday! I enjoyed the museum and the views from the 80th floor, but can't beat the 86th outside viewing! Breathtaking!!!",5.0,4.939
2540,Sunrise at ESB,Great view. Doors open the time stated on your ticket. It takes a few minutes before you are up in the top of the building and we had around 10-15 minutes before the actual sunrise.,5.0,4.4192
2541,Night view amazing ....,"We went up the Empire State Building at 1130 pm - lines where not that long going, seems a longer wait to get down but no big deal. Lots to see before you take the lift, very interesting and some great photo opportunities. View is amazing. Top was not to crowded and everyone moved to accommodate everyone having a good view or photo opportunity. Also done this in the day, I prefer evening for sure,",5.0,4.9672
2542,Different than before but still good,Visited here a few years ago but its all changed. Its still good though. We went at night time to get a different view rather than doing everything during the day. It was still busy even though it was late but worth the wait!! Highly recommend!,5.0,4.7898
2543,Spectacular,We visited here in the day after visiting the top of the rock at night. Both offer breathtaking views from very different perspectives. First class interior of the building with an insight into the history of it then out onto the observatory for the fantastic views. A must see visit whilst in New York,5.0,4.6251999999999995

2546,Brilliant,"Visited here for the second time the first time as two years ago. We went up at night time to see NYC and all it’s glory, however it was cloudy and visibility was low. This still didn’t stop our enjoyment when the cloud broke it was lovely. Just beautiful sights 360 staff are awfully friendly and welcoming and enthusiastic. Will definitely be going again on my next visit to New York.",5.0,4.9386
2547,From someone who does not impress easily,"I am not a fan of these observatories. I have been to the Eiffel Tower, the Shard in London, Top of the Hub in Boston and a few others. I only went because others wanted to go so I went. The same thing happened with the Empire State Building. My husband, my sister and I went to see NYC and this was at the top of their list. I went because majority rules. But OMG!! It is absolutely a must!!!! It is incredible. Not only do you get to truly see the history and have this monument that is inscribed into our Psyche through movies and such, it is everything and more. If there is one thing you do on your travels.. this is it!!!",5.0,4.4918
2548,Empire State Building Impressive,"What can I say? The Empire State Building is an impressive piece of architecture. The views were amazing but I felt like the 2nd floor museum was small and limited and the price for an adult and a 13 year old was steep. I had a positive experience, even though it was a holiday and quite crowded, I just felt that the pricing could be more reasonable. The staff were friendly and welcoming, for sure!",4.0,4.9566
2549,A little disappointing,"I purchased the 86 floor with no wait. The red carpet no wait was great until the security check. The red carpet ends there so you wait in line...there was about 40 people in front of me...so much for not waiting in line. After the red carpet resumes and you enter the elevators which isn’t explained but takes you to an observation deck that the pictures they take of you are on. You get to look around...no clear signage of where to go but as you wonder around you will find yourself back at the elevators you just got out of to go up to your designated floor. Again no red carpet. I was irritated already, saw the lights of the city at night and figured there’d be just as big of a crowd on the 86th as there was in the observation deck so I continued to wonder until I finally found the downward elevators and waited in line to get out of the building. No simple task...you’re paraded like cattle into and through the gift shop where people are crazed with cheesy made in China replicas of the bldg. you’re funneled through the checkout are which most people didn’t even recognized the mouse maze for those actually purchasing something...most cut the line and just went to a register (I should have too)! After that your on your own and free to leave the building. At a cheaper price the skip the line as it is would have been worth it but at the cost of it, it should have been a red carpet experience from beginning to end.",3.0,4.38
2550,No wait!,"We went around 10pm at night, and since it was quite late there wasn't really any wait, which was great. We walked through the 2nd floor exhibition pretty fast, and there wasn't really a wait for the elevators either. I really liked the view on the 86th floor. And since there were heaters all around, we weren't freezing and was able to thoroughly enjoy the view. Overall, would say this is a nice experience for someone who hasn't been to a high-rise to see the NYC view.",4.0,4.9030000000000005
2551,Lives up to expectation,"Whatever you expect to experience before you visit the Empire State Building throw it all away!! The Empire State Building is unbelievable!! From the stunning views to the interactive experiences on the way to the viewing deck it certainly lived up to my expectations!! The King Kong experience was brilliant!! The history of the building and how it was constructed is all there for you to see inside the building via screens and interactive displays!! It is a real life movie set!! Make sure you check the weather forecast before you go, we had the clearest day possible and the views are beyond stunning!! You can see EVERYTHING!! Highly recommended!! *****",5.0,4.8995999999999995
2552,Stunning vista,"We timed our visit perfectly.
We arrived at 4pm and started our walk around in daylight.
As we got to the viewing deck the light was just fading which gave stunning views all over New York as it lit up for the night.
Well worth a visit any time but especially at dusk.
Just wrap up warm, it can be a bit windy and cold",4.0,4.55
2553,Empire state building first visit,"Growing up I've watched so many movies that have shown this building in some sort of way , I've wanted to come to NY and see some cool things not just the glamorous stores of TimeSquare, But something more memorable in the historical way and I was able to feel a part of that while visiting here while standing and looking at how the building was built and how it played an important landmark role for the city and I really felt a part of me say ""WOW"" this is so ""COOL"" I went up to the 86th floor and while feeling the city flow from up there I was able to say one of my dreams of standing in this historical landmark",5.0,4.7844
2554,It’s the Empire State Building,Went on Valentines Day at night. No waiting. There’s been so much cool stuff added to the experience since we were last there. Lots of museum quality exhibits on your way tot he view which is really the whole reason to go.,5.0,3.1944
2555,Empire State,We did this as a romantic thing for Valentine's Day and had not been there in ages. Very impressed with the museum and also the ability to go all the way to the top. The heaters on the 86th were very very nice.,5.0,4.8224
2556,Ruined,"Was having a wonderful time with an after hours visit...great views, friendly staff, fun museum. Then right at the end they hit you with a photo scam where you pick the overpriced photo you want, only to have them switch it to another one and demand even more money for the one you chose. Then we found out someone had stolen my wife's jewelry. Security and management helped, but the lobby wouldn't even TALK to us. Also saw some tourists getting denied entry in the late hours even though there's no arrival requirement on the ticket. Why do they have to ruin everyone's night??",1.0,1.2328
2557,My Visit to the Empire State Building,I really enjoyed the Empire State Building. I went to the 80th and 86th floor observatories and the 2nd floor museum. The views were great!. Luckily it was a clear (but cold) day. I visited the site about 10 years ago. I remembered the 86th floor observatory from that visit but the 80th floor observatory and 2nd floor museum were new for me this time. One additional item that I liked were the heat lamps on the 86th floor observation deck. They definitely helped make it pleasant on such a cold day!,5.0,4.9108
2558,Iconic but even for us price is high!,"The Empire State Building is as iconic as ever. We were there late afternoon on a gorgeous February afternoon over the winter break (ski week in California). Loved loved loved the upgrades and the view from 102nd floor was even better than the lower floors. I want to say it was worth the upgrade but wow! $77 per person?! We also went to the World Trade Center and paid $20 per person for a similar experience (although admittedly, I thought being outside made ESB a tad better).

One tip - we didn’t purchase skip the line or the priority tickets on the ESB website and didn’t need them at the time we went (around 3pm). Happily no lines.",4.0,4.9244
2559,Best Place i ever been,My husband and I went to spend the weekend at NYC. Last time we visit the city was Nov 2017. A lot has changed. The empire state has always been my favorite place. We visit now for the first time after ther renew the 102th floor observatory. I have to say... its the best . We went sat around 4:30 got to watch the sunset.... best thing i could ever done.

2563,Worth every penny,"Yes, it's a little pricey to see the 86th-floor and new 102nd-floor observation areas, but it was totally worth it. We went on Valentine's Day, expecting long lines and crowds, but were pleasantly surprised at how smoothly everything went. All of the exhibits were top-notch and the views were sensational (the perfect weather helped). Even the visuals on the elevator rides were fun. It was frigidly cold outside, but the heated outdoor areas (86th floor) made everything warm and comfortable. Truly a memorable experience; I can't recommend it highly enough!",5.0,4.9666
2564,Rebirth,"This meant a lot to me. Late night, less crowds, the city covered in night lights. I went on the observatory's 86th floor, in what I would describe as severe windy conditions. Some didn't seem to enjoy it, holding on to their phones in the fear of dropping them. But I somehow loved it.
I faced the wind head on, saw beautiful sights and felt on the edge, as if I had crawled over the fence. It was such a raw experience and breathing in NYC in such an unfiltered manner. The experience was breathtaking and props to the saxophonist inside the observatory deck, who played some very nice and relatable songs for the audience. If you're discouraged by windy conditions and cold temperatures, you can stand on the north side of the building, where heat lamps are installed and you won't freeze, while enjoying breathtaking views over the skyscrapers in midtown Manhattan.",5.0,4.9

The view is of course spectacular, but the building itself and the staff was also terrific.",5.0,4.8936
2566,A NYC Must!,"I have visited twice. I really enjoyed the updated museum portion of the tour. It is well worth it to spend the extra $ on the very top of the building. I’ve only gone at night, so I have nothing to compare it to, but it’s a beautiful and quiet way to witness the city.",5.0,4.761

2572,Great place,"Went in february so not that busy, so we walked through without any fuss. A couple of great attractions before you get in the lift.I loved the bit where King Kong as smashed through the wall and is looking through the window.

once on top, it is as you expect and more. great place",5.0,4.8986

2574,Go Late,This is one of those experiences that is totally different during the day versus the nighttime. I actually prefer it at night. I recommend going REALLY late--like after midnight. It's open until 2am so this can be a great late night activity which will help you avoid the long lines. Buy your tickets on Groupon or another legitimate discount site to save some money.,4.0,4.7668

2576,Fantastic view,"So we were lucky with timing , there were no queues , information on Empire state building with fantastic photos of the construction all the way through the tour , you can go as fast or as slow as you want , depending if your interested in the history of the building , keeps all ages occupied, with a fun king Kong section where it looks like king king is peering through the windows, kids and adults alike queued up to get there photo in the hand of king Kong, so be prepared to wait for that , once your st the top the views are fantastic if it's a clear day and if its winter be prepared....its much cooler up there.
Gift shop on ground floor I would say like most tourist gift shops was expensive.

Security was paramount there...but that J fully understood.

Plus the views over New York were breathtaking! You could see The Bay of New York plus the Statue of Liberty.
Very informative visit and a must to anyone visiting The Big Apple.
Thank you",5.0,4.846
2583,VIP tour,"I thought the VIP tour was marginal at best. The red carpet allowed us to move to the front of the line. But the red carpet ended before we got up into the elevator. So we have to wait in the line to go from the second floor Observatory up to the 80th floor. And then from the 80th floor to the 86th floor we waited in line again. There was no audio. And the people that were supporting this event were not very friendly. The 86th floor itself was fine. I hadn't been there in 15 years and it's changed slightly. They have new heat up top. And the entrance is on the opposite side of the building. . Overall, the observation was fine, but I would not recommend doing the VIP tour. I would recommend just to just get your standard tickets and go up there and plan some time just to take some photos.",2.0,4.6975999999999996
2584,Empire State of mind,"I decided that to do both viewing platforms and museum was a little too expensive, so chose to only do the museum and 86th floor. The museum is great, love the King Kong corner! I chose to go at night, which I'm glad that I did. It was a beautiful, clear, albeit freezing night in February. The views were incredible. I could see the Statue of Liberty perfectly.
Staff are all over the place, and they are all very friendly and helpful. Fortunately, there were few people on the 86th floor when I was there, but I can imagine it will get rammed at peak times.",5.0,4.8966
2585,Fantastic with new exhibits and additional floor added.,"We have been to ESB numerous times, and were surprised to find lots of new exhibits and a viewing area on 102 floor just a year after our last visit.

2586,Lucky with the weather for amazing views.,"Saturday 8th Feb was a mostly blue sky day so we were so glad we had booked on this day. Great service, staff all friendly (except one miserable young lady). It was daylight when we went up and dark by the time we came down so we saw NYC in all its glory. Highly recommended.",5.0,4.8536
2587,Better than expected,The tour has been revamped recently. Interesting history and interactive displays. Is expensive but worth it,5.0,3.9878
2588,Seems like chaos,This is the 2nd time we’ve visited the Empire State Building and this time it seemed a lot more chaotic.,3.0,1.9174
2589,Amazing Experience,"We wanted to get there in time to see the views through the day through to sunset. Our timing was slightly off as we hadn’t expected there to be do much to see before actually getting up to the outside viewing area. However, we were allowed to go back to the parts we had missed. Very interesting and lots of historical information. Spectacular views. Outside heaters took the chill down (it was February). No lines to wait in either which was a massive bonus.
The gift shop before you leave is relatively cheap however you can’t go back to it once you’ve left the attraction itself. So if you see something you want I’d buy it there and then.
Overall an amazing experience. Have your cameras at the ready for your journey up in the lift.",5.0,4.8742
2590,World's Famous Building!,"You can't visit New York City and not see the Empire State Building! The art-deco is beautiful and I love how they are continuously upgrading and evolving. From the elevator rides to the 86th floor, it is all a worthwhile experience. The view is gorgeous just beware of the wind!!",5.0,4.8932
2591,The Empire State Building - you must have visited it once in your life!,"A visit to the observation deck on the 86th floor definitely belongs on the list of places you have to visit once in your life!
Even if there are now a number of taller buildings, the Empire State Building is still the world's most famous skyscraper. Plan also enough time to visit the interesting museum on the ground floor.",5.0,4.4354

2593,Amazing views.,"Very good organisation - no waiting time at all in the morning Sunday hours. Walk to the top of ESB is with a lot of attractions and knowledge about a place and history. Clean and tidy everywhere. On the top it was quite warm - because of the heating points.
Nice views.
Really enjoyed the visit!",5.0,4.8988
2594,Iconic building,"Really enjoyed our visit up the Empire State Building, the day we visited was very overcast and we couldn’t see far but it was still fun to do and memorable! Well worth visiting in any weather...",4.0,4.8018
2595,Magnificent,"Truly great views from the top of the tower. It is worth going up towards the end of the day, as the daylight is changing and the city lights come on. If the queue for the lifts/elevators are long, consider the walk up or down from floor 80 to 86",5.0,4.5928
2596,Great tourist stop,Definitely a fun thing to do. Family friendly with some walking. Tons of history and things to see. Even if you are to breeze through plan for a few hours. You will go up to the 80th floor first. Walk around inside and then head to the 86th floor for the outside observation deck. There are outdoor heaters to take the chill off. There are some decent size lines but things move pretty quickly.,4.0,4.711
2597,Such a wonderful experience!,This was a great place to visit. The view was stunning. We loved it. I highly recommend visiting this building.,5.0,4.849
2598,An unexpected delight,We hadn't planned to go up Empire State building as my husband and dont like heights! however it was our last full day in NY so went to look at the building. It was fairly early so made a spur of the moment decision to go up. We only went to the 86th floor and I'm so glad we did. The views were breathtaking. I'd definitely recommend as a 'must do',5.0,4.764
2599,An eye-opening experience in NYC,"Learning about the remarkable history of the world’s most famous building is one thing, but getting the chance to view the world from 86 stories high is something else. Bring a jacket, preferably with a hoodie, as the wind will easily blow any hat off and it is rather cold. We went around 9:00 PM and the line was non existent, definitely recommend this at night.",5.0,4.7668
2600,Nice Fun Visit,My daughter and I truly enjoyed the great views of New York City from Empire Estate building. It is also great to view all the movies that have been shot here or with this.,5.0,4.8742
2601,Fantastic view,We really enjoyed our early visit to the Empire State Bldg. we had tickets to the 102nd floor. Definitely a must do.,5.0,4.485
2602,Cool view. Some improvement could be made,Awesome view. Experience was cool. Very different from last time. I would recommend having photographers up the top like at Disney. Then you can purchase once your down. Or have it included in some ticket prices. Also we wanted to go back to the gift store the next day. But they told us we can’t get to it without a ticket. Sad face.,4.0,4.771
2603,A must do when I NY,"One of the top monuments you have to visit whilst in New York. Once you've found the entrance, we managed to walk past the small board near the door showing the entrance, the building is quite grand. I didn't expect the extra bits before you head up in the lift. Once at the top you get an amazing view of the city. We chose to visit in the day and do Top of the Rock at night so we could see the Empire State all lit up. It wasn't too overcrowded and you get a 360° view of the whole of New York",4.0,4.7766
2604,Statue of Liberty &Ellis Island tour,"Tour was absolutely fabulous. Mark, our guide, was very informative, personable, great sense of humor and provided a great experience. Recommend to anyone looking for a great tour.",5.0,4.9394
2605,Breathtaking,"We arrived early to join the queues, the staff were so friendly! We were quickly taken upto the 86th floor, wow oh wow the views!
We decided to visit 102 observatory deck for an additional 30 dollars and were not disappointed!!!!

I’ve never experienced anything like it in my life

A must when visiting NYC",5.0,4.8644
2606,A fantastic way to see NYC,"We purchased a ticket online that included a luncheon at The State on the bottom floor of the building and were very happy to have done that! Very good food and very good service. We were in a separate line to access the elevators although, you mix with people after the initial access until....you have another red carpet line for us in the ""skip the line"" tour ....then you go through security and then mix with the rest of the people again. Basically, you skip the huge line and just go around them to only get ahead of them before they join you ....and you join the horde that went ahead of you.
We started out on the 80th floor to go through the exhibits and then onto the 86th floor to look out over the city which has an inside area to look at the scenes and you can go outside as well. As we had tickets to the 102nd floor we went up....not very much room although, there must be about 20 people up there maybe. They limit the number of people going up to how many come down so you aren't crowded up there. We were up there about 10 minutes maybe and really....there isn't much difference from 86 stories up or 102 stories up. Just bragging rights. Yeah, I can say that I've been there and that is the highest I've ever been up other than being on an airplane but then, I've been on mountain tops so...does that count?",5.0,4.8759999999999994

2609,Great,The day we went was so windy and very cold so never stayed at the top very long. The views from the top are brilliant and a must visit. We went half hour after opening and was getting busy.,4.0,4.5012
2610,Got to be done,"Quite a long queue for the lift, but worth it. Fascinating building with so much history. Views were amazing. One of the must do places in NYC",4.0,4.8462
2611,Incredible!!,"Absolutely amazing views of Manhattan, well worth the $42 entrance fee. Late afternoon/early evening is the best time to go to get great pictures of the city during the daytime and evening",5.0,4.8936

2614,Do not miss!!,"Loved loved loved it!!
We got here just as the sun was setting so it was beautiful and then stayed as it got dark and also took pictures of the skyline at night.
It’s also good getting up to the observation deck as there’s lots to see in the building too.
This was my favourite thing to do in the whole of my New York stay.
We had bought an explorer pass via Groupon before we travelled. This gave us standard entry. We wanted to upgrade to get up to the higher floor and had to get in the normal queue to do this.
We were lucky, I think as it was February that the queue wasn’t very long. If the queue had been long it would have been frustrating waiting as we had already got a basic ticket. Our pass gave us fast track entry to the top of the Rock but not here. I plan to visit New York again and would probably check out fast track or VIP options next time incase the queue is longer.",5.0,4.9086

It’s another 30 dollars to go up from floor 86 to 102, i didn’t know know this extra pricing until I got to the 80th floor, I didn’t think I would benefit from views from the extra floors and stayed at 86, plus I thought this was very pricey.",5.0,4.6530000000000005

2642,The perfect way to end our NYC trip!,We visited the Empire State Building after dinner on our last evening and it was the perfect way to end our NYC weekend. As a family we've traveled to the city multiple times before so a visit to the top of the Empire State Building seemed a bit touristy but none of us had done it so we decided to give it a shot and it was one of the highlights! Highly recommend the extra $$$ to see the 102nd and 86th!,5.0,4.584
2643,A GREAT EXPERIENCE,"This attraction , so popular for its views for the 86th floor or even higher is an iconic art deco building. Many of the floors are occupied by businesses.

We had a crystal clear night and while it was cold, I'd have stayed longer just to take in the magnitude and lights. Truly breathtaking, and I'm a native New Yorker who feels like they've seen it all sometimes. The only downside was the gift shop was closed.

I love the Empire State Building, it’s definitely my favourite building in New York! I’ve been to the top twice; once when I first ever visited New York in March 2011 and then again in September 2019. The twice I’ve been up it, I’ve gone at night. I always recommend this to people who have never been to New York as I prefer to go up Rockefeller during the day as you get a better photo of the skyline in the light with Central Park as well as the Empire State Building and World One. Whereas when you go up at night, you get amazing photos of the city in the dark but also the atmosphere of being at the top of a building so many movies have been filmed on – it’s just magical!",5.0,4.8118

It is important to go early in the morning",5.0,4.2248
2667,"The Museum was rather entertaining, but...","... the view from Top of the Rock is much better - at least in my opinion. A) TotR is not as high up, but slightly less crowded as there are more viewing platforms on three different levels both indoors (good for rainy days) and outdoors, b) the platforms are a lot wider so no tourist ""traffic jams"" and c) this is particularly important for anybody who would like to take some nice pictures: as there are no bars in the way you can snap some beautiful pics. And last but not least: when at TotR you have a stunning view of the Manhattan skyline INCLUDING the Empire State Building which in the evening is lit up in interesting colours. So, my advice to anybody who wanted to do either or is to do TotR instead. Both cost the same. ;-)
Staff were extremely friendly and very helpful though and there were plenty around so you could always ask for directions, etc.",4.0,4.962
2668,Second visit,I visited ESB nine years ago with my youngest doughter which was fun but this time was much better because I was not in a hurry. I visited with my boyfriend and we spent quite some time in the museum before we went up to 86th floor. It was very interesting!,5.0,4.7658000000000005

2673,I wish all employees honored the Express Pass,"The Empire State Building is a ""must see"" in NYC. We opted to go to the 102nd floor. We bought the express pass which was great...for awhile. At first we really did get to bypass the lines, and it didn't take long at all for us to go to the 80th and 86th floor. However, once we got to the elevators to go on up to the 102nd floor there were some issues. My husband and I were standing in line to get on the elevator, and we should have been next. A gentleman walked up with 6 guests and told the guy working the elevator that they had express passes, and so they were put on the elevator in front of us, and we had to wait. uhhhhhh, we had express passes too, AND we were already in line. We found that very annoying, and when I said we had the pass, we were told that they were ""taking care of everyone"". Some other people had the express pass and asked about it, but they were told just to get in line because they were ""taking care of everyone"". So, it seems that while some employees honor the express passes, some others just take care of everyone regardless of the price you paid for the extra ticket.

Overall, we enjoyed the views and the experience.",3.0,4.922

Fortunately for us, the weather would recover the following day and we got to enjoy the breathtaking views of New York from the Empire State Building. Well worth the time and money. Long lasting memories made for sure. A must see and do.",5.0,4.9224
2678,"Fabulous, Even for Those Afraid of Heights","I am afraid of heights so I couldn't decide if I wanted to do this. But I am so glad I did! I felt completely safe on each of the levels we stopped on (the 80th, 86th and 102nd floors). No floors swaying because of the wind and room enough that you don't feel claustrophobic. I definitely recommend paying the extra to go to the 102nd floor. The views are great on the other floors, but they really are phenomenal from the observatory at the top. You will be taking selfies and updating your profile picture. The views are that good. And take your time enjoying the exhibits on the 2nd floor on the way up. Very interesting look at how the building was built and even a big King Kong that you can take a fun photo with.",5.0,4.9742

The rattling elevator shaft simulation, the movies and the King Kong breaking into windows was really cool too! The elevator ride is funny and narrated nicely. Already the view from the 80th floor is really nice. Also all of the attractions seen there are really informational and worth a visit. The sight from the 86th floor observation deck is just magnificient. You can see every part of New York and with the free(!) far vision goggles details are to be seen.

We went during sunset so we could see the city day and night and it was honestly the most spectacular view! I cannot describe it.

2730,Herded like sheep.,"Booked tickets on-line in uk. In wheelchair-billed as having disabled access, restaurant and facilities. Arrived, no signing, no loos just uniform guys directing you to lifts. Yes the whole site was flat and the views were absolutely stunning. Used to desciptions to advise whereabouts of previous so you can organise your day. Didn't happen,. Continual shunting of visitors form ticket scanner to lifts to different floors. Never found restaurant. Was shunted through huge shop. Worried cos only "" came a cross"" 2 loos [ not block of loos!] When complained at shunting was told they were only trying to help!!!!! Had to forcefully shout that we wanted to leave was told you have to go this way because we paid to go to a higher floor.! More emphatic pleading and were shown way out beyond some cordons Joined other people feeling similar. The ""museum"" consisted of celebrity photos with views behind. Even the lifts had blaring music with videos - nightmare. Most people under 40 and were unaware of any freedom infringement.",3.0,4.1626

2735,Magnificent view and great new exhibition,"We visited soon after the new exhibition has been set up on the 2nd floor. It’s brilliant! There are fantastic wall screens showing builders at work on the construction with rivets flying all over the place, displays showing the development of the site and there is even a massive King Kong hand that you can stand in and looked panicked while your loved ones take photos. But the exhibition is, of course, simply a way of keeping yourself busy before ascending to the Main Deck to take in the incredible view. The lifts up from the 2nd floor to the Main Deck are a work of art in their own right by the way. We used a CityPASS to visit. With the CityPASS you can go twice in a single day, but we didn’t have time to go twice so we went mid-afternoon and it wasn’t too busy. The discount you get from the CityPASS depends on how many other attractions you combine it with, but if you visit quite a few places you can make a decent saving on the normal price.",5.0,4.7636
2736,Iconic View,"We visited at night, and wow, what a view of NYC! The multimedia exhibit/presentation prior to taking the elevator to the observation deck was really first-class as well.

2761,This was my MUST see on my first NYC visit,"My hotel and Macy's were right up the street from the ESB, so after some food and shopping, I headed up. I did go at night time, thinking maybe it would be less crowded, not so. It was about 7pm or so, and it was crowded, but it's New York, so you just roll with it. I paid the regular admission cause I was on vacation and had plenty of time. I was there about 2 to 2 1/2 hours. What can I say? Spectacular!!! So many different people, from all over the world, I think I heard more speaking foreign languages than I did English. So much history and so iconic. The top viewing platform was crowded and you can stay up as long as you want, so just be prepared for the crowds, but for the most part, everyone was having fun and taking pictures for other travelers if need be, so it was a great experience. Do make sure you use the restroom on the lower floors. One more thing crossed off the bucket list.",5.0,4.9204
2762,Wouldn’t do again,Only do this once just for the point of saying you’ve been to ESB. The 30 rock observation is a much better unobstructed view.

The restaurant was quiet when we went but the staff were lovely and the food was good. Do check your bill as luckily we noticed we hadn’t had what was on it and it was a larger bill from a group that had the table before us. The food was well presented.

2780,Breath taking,Such a grand building. As soon as you step it it has the wow factor of a timeless classic. The only thing that spoils it is the hideous new buildings that have gone up near it.,5.0,4.5565999999999995
2781,Expensive,"A must do on my list for New York

It was very expensive for the 2 of us, $93 to go to the 86th floor. You can go higher but its extra $

Loved the atmosphere, the uniforms & the history of the Empire state building. Video in the lift was excellent

Views were amazing, we visited on a clear, sunny day.

Would recommend but be aware of the expense",3.0,4.9634
2782,Sunrise tour,"This tour was really worth getting up early for! Even though it was raining at 5.30am, when we got right to the top it was a fabulous twinkly sight.

2790,Unforgettable,"We vIsited at 7pm on thanksgiving (28 November 2019). Have only just got round to posting a review.

ESB was way better than we expected after reading reviews as lots had comments saying TOTR is better but luckily we had time and decided to do both and so glad we did as we both absolutely loved it. I think some of the reviews may be prior to the new exhibits? as they really added to our enjoyment especially King Kong. But even without those what a totally stunning building, it’s so iconic and I was overwhelmed at how gorgeous it is in real life. Also as expected the views from 86th floor were breathtaking and my the whole experience was topped by my boyfriend proposing at the top!! I’m pleased to say I said yes so we’re now engaged!! It was truly amazing and we will definitely be back to celebrate our engagement and wedding.

Also I’d like to visit during the day as this time was our first visit to New York and we visited ESB at night to see Manhattan lit up and TOTR during day for views of ESB and Central Park. So I’d like to do both again but the other way round.

We were worried about waiting times but the time we visited wasn’t too busy. We did queue to buy a ticket but only 10 mins or so then we were straight up in fast lifts. There was a queue to exit but it went down super quick, literally minutes so overall it felt really fast and efficient. It was flipping freezing so the outdoor heaters were definitely welcomed. We decided not to pay extra for the top floor this time but probably would on a future visit and will definitely be back!!",5.0,4.9974
2791,Stunning view,"View of the whole city, Brooklyn and Jersey from the 86th floor, absolutely incredible view, better at night.

2808,Bob....the best manager in the USA.,"There was a problem with my flexi ticket. Bob the manager sorted this out with ease. Bob didn't have to do what he did but Bob is that kind of guy. Top man.
The 2 female lift operators on the 86th floor (26th Jan about 12pm) were rude, unhelpful and believed that they were some sort of God's because they simply press a button on a remote control to open a lift door. I only asked to use the stairs, you would have thought I had told them to jump off the building judging by their reaction. Judging by how fat they were, using stairs isn't a concept that they could comprehend.
Apart from those two little Hitler's, Bob was fantastic and the Empire state building was indeed an excellent experience.",5.0,4.6844
2809,Old ones are still the best.,"Visited NYC in Jan 2020 for 5 days. Obviously one if the attractions to visit was the Empire State. We had already done the World observatory etc, & whilst it was really good, going right to the top viewing platform of the empire state was the best. Even the elevator was a show all on its own, & thats not including the exhibits before you get to the elevator. Yes, its a bit extra cost to get to the top viewing platform, but its worth it, & as i said, the old ones are still the best. Really enjoyed it... & bonus was that there were no queues due to time of the year & perfect blue skies on a clear winter day for views.",5.0,4.9746

2816,Sunrise on the rooftop,"We arrived just before 8 o'clock. There was no significant line, just 6 people in front of us.
The friendly host welcomed us and invited everyone to go buy their tickets and go upstairs by elevator.
When we arrived on the first stop, we visited the museum. Which was new for us, since we didn't see that 2 years ago on a previous visit. Back then we used the stairs to go up to the 86th floor from here.
Now we were able to use the elevator, which was fine, but the last couple of stairs to go up had their own charm. :-)
When we arrived on the 86th floor it was chilling, but nothing beats that view.
So we strolled around, stared in all directions, took pictures and after 20 minutes or so we decided to go down again.

What a perfect way to start the day!",4.0,4.8672

we were lucky because there was no one there during our visit. This allowed to pass quickly the security and take its time for each text / explanation and to go upstairs.",5.0,4.8786000000000005
2820,Awesome 360 view,"Wonderful. If you visit New York you should definitely visit the Empire State Building. Wonderful view. I recommend you to visit the Empire State Building at sunset time. We have been there 45 minutes before sunset and I would recommend that to everyone. So you have the view over New York with sun, sunset and New York at night. We bought the express tickets in advance, highly recommended in the ""high season"", otherwise the normal ticket is sufficient. The ticket to the 102 floor does not pay off, since you have a wonderful 360 degree view from the 86 floor. This is a must do when you are in New York.",5.0,4.9116

2822,Amazing,"We got here quite early around opening times. You go through a security like airport style. If go early enough there isn’t much of a que. when we went to leave at 10am it was a lot busier. The views from Empire State were amazing from the 86th floor but you can purchase a ticket to go to the 102nd floor. It was really cold up there, make sure you wrap up well. They even had a King Kong area. I would deffo recommend visiting",5.0,4.8236
2823,I can see for miles,My first visit to New York had to include the empire state surging upwards to the 85th floor and there he was King Kong animated outside unfortunately didn't see Faye outside the wind blew but what a sight blue skies and views never to forget you could see for miles in a total clear atmosphere the staff helped with any questions we must have stayed almost 2hrs and enjoyed every minute,5.0,4.6592

2829,Wow - Fantastic,"We are arrived at the building around 09:30, after walking past the building a couple of times, as it’s hard to recognise from ground level. We were given a warm welcome, by the doorman and proceeded to the security check. The international exhibitions, of the construction of the ESB were both innovative and interesting. There were no queues, so we were quickly transported to the first viewing level. The weather was sunny, with a clear blue sky, so the views were both spectacular and limitless, with the whole of Manhattan stretched out before us in every direction. We proceeded to the next viewing level and the outdoor views were equally as good, although as you might imagine it is breezy and chilly.
The whole event is very professionally thought through, all facilities are first class and everything is very smoothly handled and as a destination it is highly recommended",5.0,4.913
2830,Great view,"When we decided to come to New York we decided that we had to see all the great landmarks, this being one of them. Going up the Empire State Building just after going up the top of the rock was probably not the best thing to do, however the view from the top is amazing we purchased a skip the line ticket but the was no line to skip.",5.0,3.388

2835,Miller Family weekend in NYC,"The Skip the Line pass was worth it. ESB has definitely upgraded the experience since our first visit several years ago.

Perfect tourist activity choice for weekend activity if you have limited time to spend.",5.0,4.918

2841,Best view ever in Manhattan,Me and my wife were absolutely amazed at the building 'cause everything within was perfect. The welcoming was super from the very beginning to the tour' s last part. I absolutely recommend it. It has the best view ever and the elevator takes a little time to get to the top.,5.0,4.9424
2842,New entry displays and renovations are great,We went to the ESB in mid-November with a 4-8p entry ticket so we could see the sunset and lights come up after dark. Loved it. New entrance is on 34th Street and much easier. There weren't too many in line the Wednesday night that we went and crowd control was easy. The educational and historical displays as you enter on the 2nd floor are very well done. On the way up there is a very fun display where you can pose as if you are inside King Kong's hand as he reaches inside a window from outside the building. We went to both the main 86th floor observation deck (where you can go outside) and the 102nd floor (indoor only) where there are floor-to-ceiling windows and even more amazing views. With the renovations and changes you now exit through the original main entrance on 5th Avenue so you can still see the great Art Deco mural on the marble walls. It was pricey (about $60 each for seniors) but we really enjoyed it. I hadn't been in over 20 years and it was as magical as ever. The official Empire State Building website is really good too with lots of history about the various parts of the ESB and its history.,5.0,4.9524
2843,THE BEST!!!,We celebrated our daughter's 19th birthday on the 86th floor! Very exciting and the staff has been amazing and friendly every time we visit.

2851,There is a good reason this is a top attraction,"This was a return visit after a 30 year gap. Much has been done to improve visitor experience with lots to interest on way to observation decks.

Of note it was 45 dollar entry but additional fee to reach fi all floor. We did not do this as observation decks offered plenty.",5.0,4.2374

Pleasant staff, clean, and many spots to view the greatest city in the world.🇺🇸",5.0,4.8802

2856,"Great views, but on the pricey side.",We visited during early evening in mid January and were surprised to not have to queue. The basic ticket price of $45.73 we felt was somewhat overpriced compared to the Top of the Rock and One World Observatory and it is currently undergoing a face lift.

The sun was melting the ice from the top too quickly and it was coming down in huge chunks, see the picture!

2861,Disorganized Chaos Bordering Dangerous,"Paid for the tickets to get to the 102nd floor and gave up in the end as the line was just a scrap to get to the front, wasn't managed and the staff were disinterested in the fact people were pushing in.

Real shame as the museum part of the experience was very interesting.

Put simply, this place let too many people in and then fail to manage them. Gutted I bought the additional ticket to go right to the top, waste of money and the only real let down during a 5 day trip to NY.

Management could learn a lot from Top of the Rock as that was seamless.",1.0,1.8264
2862,Truly on Top of the World - a wonderfully curated experience!,"Fabulously put together. From the time you enter the building, allow people to pose in front of a scale model for instant gratification, to a fun and informative teaser AV playing on the roof of the lift that zips up at dizzying speed, to all the Audio Visuals on various walls that give you a sense of altitude and open space making you feel like you are in the middle of it all - on top of the world; to lifelike worker sculptures, the lovely idea of a bioscope-style view of the past as it was when the ESB was being built, and actual views of the present through 360-degree viewing observatory and far far more - all of it was curated in a well-conceptualised way, to engage, educate and endear the ESB across generations of tourists - I saw young and old, equally mesmerised by the unique experience.",5.0,4.8884

The web Express tickets cost the queue a bit but not as much as we expected. By the 80th floor everyone is in the same boat. The lift from 80th floor to 86th floor has long queues so a lot if people took the stairs to 86th where you have an outer observation deck with binoculars. You can buy tickets to 102 floor if you like on the 86th floor. There are rest rooms and drinking water facilities. There's airport type security to enter do try to travel light.

2867,2 AUSSIES ON CRUISE,Whatever anyone else says a visit to this iconic tourist site is a must. Great view reasonable queue. Good photo opportunities.,5.0,4.725
2868,Iconic!!,"We visited around 7pm on a cold and snowy Saturday night in January... and had the best time. No queues. A handful of visitors. Though the view at the very top was restricted due to cloud, it made it all the more atmospheric.
Outside had heaters but it was freezing and blowing a gale - the poor security staff on duty outside!
Staff were particularly educational and clearly took great pride in their jobs.
It’s the only gift shop we bought anything from during our entire trip!
An iconic experience we will never forget.",5.0,4.9178

2871,Great views and attentive staff,The Empire State Building is well worth a visit. The only slight downside is that the Empire State Building itself can't be seen from the top.

2891,"Cool, but WAY too expensive","As beautiful as the view was, I just don't see any reason to charge 45 dollars per person. With the number of people that must visit the attraction per year, surely you can make enough by charging a reasonable price? I was an individual, but I can't imagine taking a family of four to the top. If you purchase even nominal items at the gift shop, you would be looking at 250 dollars, easy. Folks don't come to NYC just for the empire state building, they visit the building when they are there for something else (shopping, Broadway, sports, etc.) Thus skipping the ESB is an option for people, and I can see more people doing just that with the current pricing.",2.0,4.8754

I was there before 8.30am and few visitors were around so get there then. And I got some good photos using my phone through the observation binoculars (put your phone to the binoculars and focus before taking pics).
Go early on a clear day and it's great.",5.0,4.929
2894,Absolutely loved it. Paid for premium got premium,I had taken time to research visiting the ESB before the trip and opted on getting the VIP experience because I wanted to visit the newly opened 102nd Floor and saw how long the wait times could be. Should my tickets at the velvet rope at street level and there is a literal red carpet to the top. You scan your tickets at multiple places to verify your status but from ground floor to the 102nd Observatory it was less than 15 minutes probably closer to 10. Great views all around from the Top and the observation deck on 88. We went on a Saturday and it was crowded at the top and the line to go up was a 1 1/2 to 2 hour wait. The VIP tickets clocked in at $100 a piece but I feel were well worth it for avoiding the wait and potentially expensive marriage counseling down the road.,5.0,4.9315999999999995

Having never visited before we did not know what to expect and from the queuing area at times the lines must be massive but if there would have been a wait there was plenty to look at while waiting. As I said there was no line for us to we took lots of pictures and enjoyed the lower levels as we made our way to the ticketing area and elevators. We then enjoy a fast multimedia elevator ride to 80th floor where there were great views and fun exhibits. Another short elevator ride and we were on the open air deck on the 86th floor.

I only found out Top of the Rock on my last day there. Unfortunately I went there as a last minute stop over, so didn’t get enough lead time. Cost about $45 to go up to level86. There are exhibits in. Multiple floors which you’ll naturally end up to as there’s no direct lift to 86. And it is worth seeing after all.",4.0,1.2052

The staff were all so very polite and friendly. I unfortunately can't remember the guy's name, but the staff member who took us up to the very top was lovely. He gave us tips on how to take better photos and even took some of the both of us. Wouldn't take a tip either. It was very quiet but I think that was the time of year more than time of day.

Difficult to get close to window/edge for lookout. It is worth going up if you've never been, and I only went up this time because I was with my kids.
The main thing I would suggest is do not get ""taken in"" by souvenir photos or souvenirs in the gift shop, which you have to walk through to exit. Very expensive, and most of those items are available for cheap in Chinatown.",4.0,3.8398
2993,Epic iconic building,"As the title says, an epic and iconic building to visit. Very attractively designed interior done in Art Deco?. Lots and lots of facts and previous photos to absorb. You have a couple of options for the level(pun intended) of ticket to purchase, with the option to upgrade while you're up there, which is a good idea. The weather obviously plays a massive part in the success of your visit, it was a cloudy day sadly, but the very helpful young lady at the entrance advised us very well, it cleared enough to enjoy incredible views as suggested. All round a wonderful experience, with one minor niggle. It is in my opinion quite expensive an activity for what it is. However, it is completely worth it. An amazing experience. Once in a lifetime if you live in the UK like myself. Highly recommended.",4.0,4.9792000000000005

Tip: the store products could be more interesting.",5.0,4.82

3019,Empire State Building visit,"My 10 year old grandson has been wanting to see NYC since he was 4, we went on a Sunday, I had no idea it was so expensive to go up to the top of the Empire State Building but decided to anyway, we had a good time, but it wasn’t exactly a relaxing time, you’re shuttled like cattle from 1 line to another, through an X-ray machine just like in the airport, expect to do some waiting. I will say , the view from both floors was amazing, but once was enough.",4.0,4.9336
3020,Stunning Views,Stunning views of a crazy city. The walk up prior to the elevator was interesting and informative. It was very quiet on the day I went and there was no queuing and plenty of room at the top.

We kept being ushered through until we got to the ticket office, the lady there couldn’t have been more rude and condescending if she tried. I was told that I hadn’t asked the right person or gone to the desk and that I had to go all the way back. So i tried to do this, I explained to a very helpful employee ‘Bob’ who tried to take me through a shortcut to get back, someone else then appeared (a manager?) and started shouting that Bob was stepping on her??

3045,Overpriced and unorganised,"Having visited NY twice previously and used other viewing platforms to see the Empire State Building, with the new glass viewing platform on 102nd floor we thought it worth a whirl.
My main complaint is the lack of supervision when queuing to go from the 88th floor to the 102nd floor using the elevator. There were numerous adults skipping the line (queue). There were many families with young children, standing inline patiently, however several couples just walked to the front. They were never confronted by staff. If there was more staff supervising this could be managed better and the problem be eliminated. My group (4) and others felt frustrated and annoyed. This made the trip

Despite being quite busy we flowed through the exhibition areas, security and the ticket area. The staff were friendly and courteous.

One glitch in the matrix was that to go to the top of the attraction you had to pay more money. Not something a family want to hear for an already squeezed holiday budget. We paid for our visit using a city pass so potentially missed out on the ticket options that would have informed us of the extra charge.",4.0,4.9322
3076,Good times even though very crowded,I definitely recommend the express line. Helps ease the long wait. Other than that the usual over crowded site. Which is expected since it is a part of New York history. Definitely recommend it. Just be patient.,4.0,4.852

The Empire State Building is such an incredible building, they have set up the walk to the elevators well and once you there you have inside and outside options which is great during weather extremes to have a break inside!

Watching the sunset was beautiful, it was not even that busy. We got to see the view in daytime and night time. The store is also a really good one.",5.0,4.8822
3083,Simply Amazing and very high!,"My first visit to NYC, I’ve always dreamed of seeing the iconic buildings and wasn’t disappointed.
We visited on Christmas Day in the evening. It was very busy but seemed to be well organised and we didn’t even queue.
I do feel unnerved these days (that’s normal for me!) when I have to go through the airport scanners so I felt a touch of anxiety with how many people they let in.
I loved the King Kong special effects whilst waiting to get in the lifts and the special effects on the ceiling in the lift as you head up to the 82nd floor, it does add to the excitement.
Once you’re up there the views are utterly breathtaking and you could look for hours, the scale of NYC is amazing and all the lights were so pretty at night.
For me the vertigo did set in while my bf was loving taking lots of pictures. I did feel like they let too many people up at once, it was too busy and I felt like I was fighting through the crowds a little on the outside observatory 86th Floor.
Overall though it’s a must when in NYC, it’s amazing. 😍",5.0,4.9884
3084,Crazy direction and staff,"The signs to get tickets, as the almost inexistent and useless staff that keep scouting at wandering tourists, is really messy. It spoils the eventual view from the top, after an endless queue outside.",2.0,1.9064
3085,An iconic NYC ‘Must Do’ which didn’t quite live up to expectations,"Another bucket list item ticked! You could face eight wait lines: the airport-style security check point after the entrance; the self-service kiosks/ticket office; the second-floor elevator line to the 80th floor where you get in another line for an elevator to the 86th floor open air Main Deck; the line for an elevator to the 102nd floor Top Deck; and a repeat of the three elevator lines to get back down. Wary of comments regarding the potential queues, we pre-booked VIP Express tickets. A bonus is that the tickets are valid for the date selected but there are no fixed entry times and you can stay as long as you like within the opening hours. We arrived at 1100 am. At security and the second floor, there was a separate VIP line with red carpet. After this, everyone was directed into the same line. Whilst we can’t really complain as we experienced no delays, we did grudge paying for a VIP experience we didn’t need and didn’t get. If you plan arriving before 1100, I wouldn’t bother pre-booking.

You will be asked to pose for a printed photo which you can buy at the end of your tour for an additional fee (most the photos didn’t seem very good). On the second-floor, you have to follow a narrow route through the exhibits – not easy when it is crowded. We didn’t spend much time here – the information about the building’s construction and evolution would have been interesting if we hadn’t already done the research, including listening to the audio-tour. There was a long queue for cheesy selfies with King Kong’s fingers which seem to have pierced the walls as he dangles from the building and dodges vintage fighter planes. The Main Deck was busy, but not too bad. It was orderly and you could move around easily for photos. The views were OK, but we didn’t think they were anything special. We decided against going up to the Top Deck (102nd floor) as this meant queuing and paying for an additional ticket. On the way back down, you have to walk through the gift shop - most the souvenirs are pretty tacky. You will exit via the art deco Lobby onto 5th Avenue. The 24-carat gold and aluminium leaf mural depicting the skyscraper with beams of lights radiating from the mast was probably the highlight of our visit. We were done in less than an hour. We are glad we visited this ‘Must See’ icon, but wished our expectations hadn’t been quite so high.

There is a selection of eateries on the Lobby level and in the surrounding neighbourhood. We enjoyed a decent, reasonably priced lunch at the Heartland Brewery and Rotisserie, which is handily located right by the tour exit.",3.0,4.9886
3086,WOW,"The views are spectacular, the line to get in was long, but be patient as you will not be disappointed. You can see just about everything NYC has to offer. The views are amazing.

3088,No Valentine,"Isn't it funny, the perspective you get from seeing something on a tv show or in a film. It apparently appears as though you could just say hi to the reception desk then potter on up the lift to assess the view.

Ha ha, not a chance. We had quite a lengthy queue through the exhibition area, then worked our way through security, queued for our ticket and then more exhibition before getting to the first lift.

Our transition was helped by courteous friendly staff and other tourists, like ourselves, were in no particular rush so it flowed without any issues.

I was a little surprised to find that if we wanted to go further up we had to pay an additional charge. When you're scheduling and budgeting for a family visit it would help to know these things first.

I definitely recommend this iconic building as your choice for a view of the city.",4.0,4.9028
3089,Better than I thought it would be,"Granted, we went at a time when it was sparsely attended, which was a huge plus after seeing how much space they dedicated just to lines. The night weather was beautiful too, so the views of New York were outstanding. The elevator ride provides a bit of entertainment by using the ceiling to show a fun little video as you ride up, and they have a cheesy King Kong hand you can pose in, so y'know, they get points for trying. They don't miss a trick trying to sell you touristy things and it's too expensive, but we're glad we paid the money since in the end, we'll actually never miss the money, but we'll have the memories of being on top of one of the most iconic buildings in the world.",5.0,4.9214
3090,Iconic adventure with long queues & position jostling,This is an experience you cannot miss! However don’t be surprised with the queueing involved to get to the top. If you have mobility challenges you will stand for long periods & tackle stairs at times. Jostling for position on the upper decks to take photos is also something that can be quite confronting. But the views are incredible both during daylight hours & at night! You will not be disappointed if you can be patient with the wait & other tourist’s behaviour.,4.0,4.3796

The weather was gorgeous today and extremely windy on the 86th floor, I was glad we had jackets with us. Everyone was extremely friendly and one of the elevator guys had quite a sense of humor.

3100,Loved it!,"We had pre booked tickets for a VIP pass to both floors. We had booked it for the 30th which was the evening we landed in NYC. We got to the Empire State building around 9pm, there were no queues. We went straight in but were then told when we got inside that there was no view from the top. We asked the lady if we could exchange our tickets for a different day and she said that if we went to the ticket office they would be able to help us. On the way out we went to the ticket office and he said that it wouldn't be a problem for us to come back the day after. He was so friendly! I think it's really good that they tell you when there's no view from the top as they could just take your money.

We went back early the next day and went straight up in the lift, no queuing. The views from the top are amazing! Definitely worth seeing.

When we left there was a massive queue around the block though so would recommend getting queue jump tickets if you are in a rush!",5.0,4.97

We were lucky as we had New York Explorer passes which allowed entry at 7.30am but if not go at 8am or you may find yourself queuing for hours...The attraction is fantastic and you will have more time aswell going early and have more photo opportunities as they have built a new entrance. Going through this is all interactive and the King Kong area is so good. The lift going up and down is so smooth so if you are a little phobic you will not have a problem at all.

3105,What a let down!,"Went with a group and arrived to discover a queue.......... the first of a very very long queue, but really seven different queues!
Standing outside the building, a 100 metres from the entrance we began the “drag”.
Once inside the building the queue then snaked around the ground floor before reaching a lengthy staircase. At this point, I have some mobility limitations, I wanted to give up, however, an attendant spotted my walking stick and standing difficulties and ushered a few of us to a lift which circumvented the staircase. What relief. However, we only reached another queue, security and the whole rigamarole involved. Then another queue for the first lift. We made it........ though with diminished enthusiasm.
A slower lift than the Observatory lift (where we only queued through security), but we made a viewpoint.....sort of! The older building had smaller window viewpoints, though the views were fascinating.
Then to the Top..... oh wait, another 30 minute queue!
At this point I sought to question an attendant for assistance only to meet initially with a failure to note my presence then with blatant rudeness.
There was no way I could get to the top.
With the amount we had paid we had thought we had secured “priority” entrance..... but no. Do check.
Frustrated and a little angry and with most of the group returned to ground level (two did make the top). Our guide agreed it was a worthless visit.
What a shambles.
Would not advise anyone to visit the building.",1.0,1.9508
3106,Go early!,"We took advice and went early (around 9am) to avoid the queues and it made such a difference. We were straight in - really welcoming staff, photos with King Kong, interesting exhibits then up for the simply breathtaking views. Loved every second.

3107,1/1/2020 visit,"We purchased tickets ahead of the time thinking we were going to skipped the line. It turned out you still have to get in line with everybody. Everyone has to go through security check. The system is similar to the airport. On the day we went, the line was long but it was moving. After you went through the security, they made you take pics with green screen on the background. We had no plans on buying the pics which you can print:purchase at the end of your visit. Then you go through the observation deck which has pics (animated) that showed the history about the Emoire State Building. It was very neat & fun! We enjoyed it very much! The wait to get to the 86th floor with elevator was a little bit long because of the crowd and only a couple of elevators working. Once you got to the outside, we were surprised that they have heaters which was very nice on cold winter weather. We thoroughly enjoy our visit.

3111,Well Worth the Visit (and Cost...),"My wife and I just completed the Premium VIP tour of the Empire State Building and we both agreed that this tour was perhaps *the* best guided tour we have ever taken. Of course the building and the views are pretty amazing but what made this tour special was our guide Siobhan. Maybe because of the time of year but this turned out to be a private tour for just the two of us which was great since it let up decide what we wanted to see and how long to see it for. And it is obvious that Siobhan really is passionate about the ESB (and knows a LOT about it!)

This tour took us through the 2nd floor museum, the beautiful lobby (which I'm not sure is included in the regular tours), down to the basement (definitely not a part of any other tour) and although it doesn't say so in the tour description, we were also taken up to the 102nd floor as well.

Once through security things moved fairly seamlessly with the opportunity to browse in the pictorial and video gallery or to proceed directly to the lifts to the 80th floor. Lift very smooth and you would hardly know you were moving. Good picture ops on 80th floor through windows however you can go up to 86th floor by lift or stairs and that floor is open to the elements with possibly better picture ops but fairly chilly with wind chill when we visited in early January.

The viewing windows on the 86th. floor were also ""people"" free which gave plenty of time to view the NY skyline without feeling pressure to move on quickly.

The outside viewing area on the 102nd. floor was very windy with a high wind chill factor but with clear weather the views were outstanding.

We arrived in the ESB lobby this afternoon, a freezing January weekday during low season, but of course this is NYC so there are still a decent number of tourists even if there’s no line. That doesn’t seem to resonate with the lobby entrance staff though. More than a dozen of us had accumulated by the reception desk over the course of several minutes before a staff member could finally be bothered to give instructions as to where to go. Unfortunately by this point, we had already purchased the express line tickets (a $70+ premium over the base rate for two tickets) from the only ticket dispensary in sight. It turns out that regular tickets are available if you go around the lobby, but this wasn’t clearly marked. Obviously an attentive staff member could’ve stopped us from wasting money on skip the line tickets when there’s no line, but that would require them to actually work on the job instead of drinking in the janitor closet or whatever it was that made them unwilling to attend to guests in a timely manner, and that just wouldn’t be a reasonable expectation, would it?

The staff member was attentive enough to comment on what a waste it was to buy the express tickets though, so thanks for that? I then asked whether it would be possible to get a refund on just the express option on the tickets and she just laughs and mutters something about “foreigners”, even though we’re US citizens and speak accentless English. We were so shocked that we had to take a few seconds and stare at her to see if she realized what she just said, but she just looked away and pretended nothing happened.

Most staff at the observation floors weren’t much better, to the point where you’d think they might be taking bets as to how rude and unhelpful they could openly be without any repercussions whatsoever. Again, it’d be understandable to a degree if this was peak season on a summer weekend when they’re getting swarmed, but there was nowhere near enough people today to justify this kind of can’t-be-f’d attitude. A few of them literally couldn’t even be bothered to speak when we asked for directions to the next floor—they just pointed around the corner without even looking at us. Oh and it turns out that the next elevator up was actually right next to the one we came up on—they just made us go around the entire floor for their own amusement, I guess?

I have no idea what management thinks is acceptable customer service, because as things stand they may as well be prison guards minus the physical abuse, but at least prisoners didn’t pay $200+ for the pleasure.

Strongly, strongly suggest staying far away. There are plenty of other observation decks available across the city. For example, we went up to Top of the Rock a few days earlier and their staff clearly cared about actually being employed.",1.0,1.3168

The morning we went was a glorious sunny winters day.

First you pay and then they tell you you have to use our site to get access to the left photos. Newyorzipport is a poor site without any good management and nobody can get their photos.

3169,Amazing views,"We choose to visit The Empire State Building at 8am on a Sunday morning so probably the quietest time, hard any queue’s. Think if you went later in the day it might be worth buying express tickets which lets you queue jump. Also definitely go to floor 102, absolutely stunning but can make you feel a bit queasy.

Skip the line tickets not worth it as we still queued for 30 minutes each way for elevators. Seems total chaos at the moment - maybe its because it’s all just new and re-opened as it wasn’t this bad on our last visit 2 years ago...

3191,Fantastic Experience,We visited the ESB in December and we arrived around 4pm. We had pre-paid tickets so we had no need to wait in the queue and we went straight through to the lift section via security. We had timed our visit perfectly because by the time we reached the top of the ESB the sun was setting and we got some fantastic photos. We then continue to the outside and watched the city start to sparkle against the night sky. Fantastic views of the Manhattan skyline.,5.0,4.9068000000000005
3192,Amazing!!! Breathtaking views. But be prepared to WAIT,The line is very long. I suggest looking up trending hours and avoid those!!!! Early morning is usually good but the night view is gorgeous! Make sure you say hello to the Sax man! It is also a pretty crowded once you get to the top. And if you pay extra and go higher u are super crammed in a little plastic tube. It's very claustrophobic but worth it! The elevator rides are fun too!!,5.0,4.968

It was decided that we would trek up to the top of the Empire State Building now that they have a 102nd floor observatory! This is a must if you decide to go visit! You go to the 82nd, 86th and 102nd floor. The elevators are fairly quick. It is much faster to take the stairs when going back down from the 86th to 82nd. We were disappointed with our group picture that they take as you come in to the building and head to the elevators. The photographer rushed us and I wasn't even looking at the camera. We declined to purchase. That was my only drawback.",5.0,2.1252

We waited over 2 hours to get to the top, and walked up the last 6 flights to avoid another hour wait for the second elevator. Buying tickets ahead of time is no use, unless you by the express pass which lets you skip the lines. Otherwise, while you are waiting in line, you can purchase the tickets at kiosks. Hugely overpriced, most underwhelming experience in NYC. The ""museum"" was cheesy, cheap, and uninformative. The viewing deck was crowded and the view was meh. I wish we hadn't gone and wasted over $100 to spend 4 minutes seeing the city. We just felt stressed, claustrophobic, and agoraphobic.",1.0,3.0144

3205,timing is everything,This was our 2nd trip in 3 months (different grandkids). The crowds were horrific. The kids couldn't get close enough to the exhibits to appreciate them. They couldn't get close enough to the edges to enjoy the views. We constantly waited on line. It was the Christmas-New Years Break. I'd never take anyone there again during the BIG holiday breaks. Otherwise it's a fabulous trip..the recent exhibits added have been wonderful to understand the magnitude of the job it took to build the Empire State Building.,2.0,4.7668

3208,Short queues late at night,"We decided to visit the ESB after watching a musical on Broadway, as we had found out that the last lift up is as late as 1:15am. We arrived around 11:30pm to discover a very short queue (probably under 50 people). Annoyingly, after queuing for security for about 10 minutes, another 50 or so people arrived and walked straight past the queue towards the member of staff who was monitoring the queue. The staff member seemed annoyed and radio'd reception to ask why he had been sent so many people all at once when he should only have one queue at that time. I'm not sure what was said back but he seemed annoyed and then just let them merge with the current queue, which was irritating for the rest of us. Once past security, we got up to the 86th floor pretty quickly and the views were spectacular. We were relieved that there were heat lamps up there, as it was VERY windy that high up. We didn't go right to the top (which is believe is something like the 103rd floor) as a staff member told us it would be another $30 each to upgrade our tickets, which seems a bit extortionate. Overall, the view made up for the slight inconvenience of the queue, and we didn't feel that the view could be $30 better less than 20 floors up.",4.0,4.7052
3209,Empire State Building Express Tour,A good idea to buy the express ticket but I went on a very busy day and the crowds were unbelievable. The express ticket allowed me to get through with a bit of ease. Employee's handled the crowds well but going up to the 102 floor was a real long and confusing wait. The glass elevator on the way up to 102 floor is enclosed so you cannot see out. Not the experience I was expecting. Had to ask for a lot of guidance to get the benefits of my very expensive ticket. All in all it was a fascinating experience but do no go during the holiday season. I went on Jan 2.,3.0,4.897
3210,Lots of long lines,"First off, we did not see the advantage of paying more for a ""avoid the line"" ticket. The Red Carpet does not extend throughout entire tour.
My husband and I wanted to experience the Observation Deck of many favorite movie locations for ourselves, so together with another couple we purchased $40.00 tickets online for a Thursday afternoon just after New Years. We did expect some wait and we also expected a smooth experience. It was a smooth experience for those with a LOT of patience. This is not an experience for young children. Once we got onto the first elevator to the 80th floor we waited to get a spot at one of the windows to catch a view. Then the unorganized (no designated/corded line) wait for the next elevator to the 86th floor observation deck where the magic of movies happened seemed to take forever! Again the volume of other tourists lined up around the deck (which appears MUCH wider in the movies) made the experience less than romantic. The staff was attentive once you got close to the elevators and exits.
So our bucket list item was checked...glad that's over!",3.0,3.6228
3211,Empire visit,"Went early but still loads of queing!
Good views and sum crowd control in place could be better the queue was miles long when we left",4.0,4.6796
3212,Christmas Trip to New York,"Wow, what a change in 10 years! I last visited the Empire State Building with a friend in Nov 2009. I have to say the building is now more of an attraction rather than wanting to see the city from a decent height. Once you've queued and negotiated the airport style security to enter, there are further queues to get to the lifts. We went in the evening (it's open until 2am) so the views of the city on a clear night were excellent. One major concern was the volume of people at the top. There were no signs, no staff taking charge and although there were roped off sections towards the exit, the amount of people made it impossible to see the ropes. It was obviously dark and with no member of staff giving direction, it had the potential to become dangerous for those attempting to leave the area to exit the building. There is competition with the Top of the Rock and the WTC Observatory (we did all 3) but the Empire State Building is definitely worth a visit if only to see the opulent entrance on the first floor by the original lift entrances. Do not turn up before your allocated time as you will NOT be allowed to enter.",3.0,4.8898

3220,A New View On New York,"The new interior design connects old and new in the best way possible so that the Empire State Building presents itself in a very modern way without losing its nostalgic and iconic character.
Also the museum is a combination of past and present, it allows the visitor to become a part of the history of the Empire State Building in a vivid setting with interactive features.
The most memorable part of my visit was looking at New York from the 102nd floor observatory. Due to the renovations in 2019 the rather small windows have been replaced by gigantic 360 degree glass fronts, that offer an uninterrupted view on the city, it almost feels like you were hovering above New York. In addition to that the observatory is a rather silent and calm spot where you can relax and where you do not feel the turmoil of the city that you are looking at.
If you want to visit, my personal advice is to get a ticket for both 86th and 102nd floor, also you might want to get an Express Ticket that allows you to skip the lines. It is definitely worth it!",5.0,4.9214

Inside there is a lot of activities before a fantastic final with a view on Manhattan. Pretty cool by night. For me the view is better on the Top of the Rock but the museum is better in the Empire. And the photo with King Kong, awesome!!",5.0,4.926
3245,Amazing Views,"The views from this place are stunning.

The building is actually quite difficult to locate - you'll only know you are in the right place when you see a very long line of people queing to enter the building.

Once you have managed to get into the building you get into the lift - which is an experience in itself !! the roof of the lift has a video playing as you are rising up which makes it a great experience.

Once you get to the top - the views are simply stunning.

I would strongly advise anyone to visit this place.",5.0,4.791

3251,I expected more,"Visiting the ESB is has turned into a classic NYC must so we visited. The bad thing is there are lanes and lanes and lanes, to get to the building, inside and to get to the top, so what? It’s NYC, but there was no order, employees didn’t indicate u where, when, which side, nor there where signs to just follow (so u wouldn’t have to ask) there’s a spot to take a picture with a ESB on the back and you’d loose your place if you did that. It was a stressful visit more than a “off the bucket list” ...in my experience u can go to any other observatory to view the city, I’d leave this one probably as a last option.",2.0,1.1856

3270,Bad service,Be careful when you book your visit. Don't do it too much in advance and look at the weather. We didn't do that and we ended up at the top with no view at all. We asked for a refund but they wouldn't agree to it. Instead they said to come on another day but we were leaving NYC the following morning! 400$ is a lot of money for no view at all!!!!,2.0,1.4794

3284,Disappointing,We went on New Year’s Day expecting it to be busy however did not expect the whole experience to last 3 hours. There were too many people allowed in with only one elevator down working. We also could not get up to the 102nd floor which we had paid for as this elevator was not working either. I felt that we spent most of the time queuing. I would suggest purchasing the express ticket,2.0,3.0

3286,Superfluous if you already done World One!,It took some time for us to figure out the entry. Once entered the building there were security guards and they never let us to enter for the tour from inside. We had to come out of the building. He was not even courteous to tell us how to go. I think with the modem day sky scrapers and having seen the NYC panoramic view from World One it was never exciting! Perhaps a good idea to go and dine either lunch or dinner on top which is not there in World One!,3.0,1.7454
3287,Great views but long wait,We went at night and were there between Christmas and New Years. We all really liked the view of the city. The line was really long. Waited over 30 min outside and then took another 45 minutes to get up to observation deck.,4.0,3.9508
3288,Empire State Building,"The check in was relatively fast, there was not a line because the visibility was low that night. There were many workers but it seemed like we were an annoyance asking for help when the ticket reader wasn’t working and letting us through. The lady yelled over to me “scan it to go through” and I said it’s not working and she rolled her eyes and said scan it. I asked if someone could come help us because it wasn’t working. We paid extra for skip the line and the “red carpet” and were not treated very kindly at all. The view from the top was pretty great but trying to get up there was extremely frustrating and made us want to immediately leave. When you pay over $200 to look off a tall building you at least want the staff to be helpful when their scanner isn’t working. Made us not ever want to come back and be really irritated at the money we spent.",3.0,4.7846
3289,Amazing experience,"Myself, my daughter and son in law visited ESB at the beginning of December, we went along early when it opened, we used our city passes which do save a lot of money and we had no problems at all with queues. What an amazing place, there is lots to look at on the way to the elevators, it's all really interesting, the lift was amazing people who have been will know but I'm not going to give the surprise away for others who haven't been, it fascinated me how quickly you can get to the top. The views are absolutely breathtaking, I loved every minute of it, I would definately visit again. There is a lovely gift shop with some beautiful gifts, although I bought myself a lovely cup that unfortunately broke as soon as I made a drink in it, so looks like thats my excuse to go back again and buy another lol. For me this was one of my favourite experiences in NY, I did visit TOTR and personally for me ESB beats it hands down.",5.0,4.9822
3290,Express ticket issues,"We bought express tickets to skip the line. Outside the building the line was a couple block lines. We (along with other groups) showed the guard our express ticket and was told that didn’t work on the line outside. We spoke to another guard and were told only VIP tickets skipped the outside line,express tickets didn’t. Thankfully we didn’t give up and spoke to the final guard at the door who let us through. Once inside we were very glad we had express tickets. Worked like a charm on all lines including going from 80th to 86th floors.

Heating on viewing area on 86th floor was a great idea. Very nice. Views were wonderful at sunset.

Would have been 5 stars except for line issues",4.0,4.946

3292,Evening VIP Experience,"We pre-booked our tickets to visit the Empire State Building at night online and paid $93 pp to visit the 82nd and 102nd floors. It was lovely seeing all the lights of the City that never sleeps, but ridiculously cold and windy on the observatory tower we didn’t stay out there long. If you go at night it’s definitely not half as busy as day tickets so prob no need for the VIP (as there were no extras we noted) but there was a lack of staff visible too. Would recommend the night experience.",5.0,4.6736

There are now displays to look at and the line moved much faster. Of course there were not as many people there as when we visited before due to the date and weather. We went as high as you could go. We had one adult, one student and a senior and I believe the cost was $220 total which is still a bit pricey. Great view from an iconic landmark.",4.0,4.7614
3300,Waste of money,"We paid for the express line option and 102nd floor. Whilst we got to the 86th floor express, we had to wait 20+ minutes to get to the 86th via lift or we were offered to walk up the stairs! Once we entered, we were then told the 102nd floor was closed - which is what we wanted to see. They dont tell you when you book.

I'm not one for heights so getting me up to 86 floors was an achievement. Back to the lift 100+ floors up and in to the top viewing deck. Just an amazing experience.

We bought the ticket and then had to wait in long, slow moving queues. In our family we had a 73 year old who felt the waiting around was hard as she had to stand for the whole time.
We than had to queue to get up the elevator which was going to be a 45 minute wait! Therefore we took the stairs as we were sick of waiting for so long already. This was hard on my nan, 73. Then we had to queue on the way back down- all we wanted to do was leave but it took nearly as long as it did to get up.
I always thought there were time slots for the Empire State Building...I was obviously wrong but believe it would be better if there were!

3327,Early Morning Trip,We got to the Empire State Building about 15 minutes after it opened. This meant no long queues. However we were definitely not alone in our idea of an early start and by the time we left it was busy. I definitely would recommend getting to the ESB for opening time.

After being told to join the main queue we waited 2 hours to get to the turnstiles and realise we had been told to join the queue for the day as there are no time or date tickets issued. Luckily one of our party ran to a booth to swap our online confirmation for real tickets.
Another hour wait to get up to 80th floor as we were told they were at capacity, even though those with express tickets were taken straight up. When we reached the 80th floor we had to walk the final 6 floors as there was yet another queue for the elevator. Once on the 86th floor the view is good, however I’m not sure it was worth the unplanned 3 hour wait!! Finally there was yet another queue to come back down. It would be helpful if staff were advising people to join the correct queue and informing them of wait times outside the attraction so people can decided whether or not they want to join the queue if they have open ended tickets (most are valid for 1 year).",1.0,4.9356

A times building personnel urges people to take the last 6 floors on foot, but without safety or health warnings. Specially because each floor is double height.

And of course the 102 nd floor deck was closed and for us that what's the highlight of our trip from Panama.

But either way, it was a very good experience.

After waiting for an hour and a half to get to that point, we were told that it would be 45 minutes to an hour to get to the 86th floor. Finally the stairwell was opened and we could walk up the six floors. After visiting the 86th floor, it was a wait for elevators back to the 80th floor. Again, they finally opened up the stairwell to go down. Upon reaching the 80th floor, it was a wait for the elevators to the ground. The whole operation was poorly handled, especially in light of the Christmas vacation. The staff should have been prepared for the extra demand.",2.0,3.6364
3380,SPECTACULAR,We entering with a reserved track so to avoid a very long line! Then inside you discover a treasure of marbles designed in a Liberty style. Elevators get’s to the 86 th floor and you seem to have quite a look upon the big Apple in 360 degree view.

The observation floor 80 was a building site last time, but now is a wonderful space, with great views and the interesting pointers to where everything in the city is. You also get to see things like grand central station through the viewers that are positioned around the floor. We got a very clear day so had fabulous views from the open deck.

3388,Capitalism at its best (worst!),"So on Christmas Day we decided to visit. We queued outside the building, inside on ground floor, upstairs on first floor, buying tickets, going through security, through the turnstiles, for the lifts and then we got to the first observation floor which is the 80th floor.
Now I am not small in height but trying to see over three deep groups of people is challenging. So we joined another queue for the 86th floor. The queue was so long that staff, who were friendly, offered people the option of walking up six floors to beat the queue.
We arrived on the 86th floor observatory deck and almost had to fight our way out onto the platform. A most unenviable experience.
Now I know they have to make money, and it is not cheap, but surely they should control the flow into the building and let people have a pleasant experience! However I guess when it’s about money that is all that matters!",1.0,4.5776

3399,Empire State Building 86th Floor Observatory Visit,"This was our first visit to New York and visiting Empire State building was a must. We visited on the 27th of December. I had the option of buying my tickets online beforehand but did not do that since weather forecast had chances of rain.Once i saw that there were no chances of rain that day i bought my tickets for the 86th floor observatory(includes 80th floor and museum) inside the building (automated kiosk so the queue moves fast). I visited around 3 pm so that i could enjoy both day and the night time views of Manhattan. Another thing i noticed is that buying tickets online makes you choose time of visit while buying tickets at the building itself has no such option. Also once inside no one checked for the time of my visit so i think that is just to regulate the crowds. The 86th floor observatory is a visual treat and is worth the money. Especially the night time views of Manhattan are simply out of this world. Didnt do the 102nd floor since it was double the ticket cost and is not an open air observatory like the 86th floor. All in all spent around 3 hours there, took a lot of pictures and selfies with the manhattan skyline backdrop and had a great time in the 'most famous building in the world'.",5.0,4.8954
3400,A must do in New York,"The queues were long but moved quite quickly. I would suggest pre purchasing tickets as there were queues to self purchase the tickets. Go early or late to avoid the crowds.

3406,Stunning views of NYC,"Best to go early on in the day and buy tickets online. It is expensive but as an iconic building and the history of having it built, it is worth it. We did pay the extra charge to go to the 90th floor as the views are great from 86nd floor.",4.0,4.75
3407,See it at the top,"Go Early!!!!! Huge lines but worth it.

We brought tickets when we got there and to be honest all the ‘discount tickets’ you can get your savings is not much.

With super expensive tickets we were packed in like sardines for over two hours in room after packed hot room with zero information about what was going on for over two hours. Could barely see anything at the top and were told on 86th floor that 102 floor was closed after we had paid to see that floor. Told to get refund from ticket office.

3414,"Great time, friendly staff, awesome view",Iconic building that many of us older than 30 have known about all our lives from movies and tv. Well worth the the visit if you want a great view of NYC and N. NJ. We went between Christmas and NYE so extra traffic in every line but the staff is so good and equipped to handle it well and quickly. The tour isn't low cost but we were happy we did it. I know my mother in law and my wife loved it and though it was cold out they took their time going all the way around the building stopping every few feet to enjoy the view. Even the teenage boys had a blast and a new appreciation for the history in building this and so many other sky scrapers. I wish we had gone back late night and will next time for sure. Overall a great staff ready to make you feel welcome and help get you to the top quickly. Views are amazing and helped with the understanding of how big the metropolitan area is. Awesome visit.,5.0,4.9942

The views from 80th floor and from 86th floor were sublime, but the view from 102nd floor exceeded all expectations. The most exciting arrangement is the electric heater on 86th floor open platform. So imaginative and helpful!!!. Only one hiccup - if somebody doesn't come with printed ticket or mobile ticket there should be arrangement to issue ticket based on credit card which was used to pay the ticket earlier.",5.0,4.6318
3417,Go early,"We visited on a very cold Saturday morning at the end of December when the crowds in the city were quite large. We had read that the best time to go is first thing in the morning and so we arrived when it opened at 8 AM. By the time we were leaving the lines were quite long to access the elevators to the observatory and to get through security. We were using a city pass and were able to go to security and then on to where they scan your tickets without having to stop to exchange for tickets; the city pass seem to be a convenient thing to use at this location. Obviously the views are incredible from the observatory but the museum is also quite impressive. My children, ages 7 and 12, very much enjoyed the experience!",5.0,4.8952
3418,The view is amazing as always,"I've been here 10 years ago and in 2019. The view and the service is on great level, however it takes a lot of time to go up due to numerous observatory decorations and crowded people in front of it. Would be great to simplify the ""going up"" process, so that it would be really easy to skip the observatory attractions.

Thanks!",3.0,4.9088
3419,Night time view,"Went at a busy period, hence queuing time was quite long to get through security. Good exhibition before going in lift to 80th floor.

3422,What a View!!!!,This was one of our highlights from our trip to NYC we visited here twice once first thing in the morning and once at night both was equally amazing! It was very windy and very cold so wrap up warm. Would recommend to get here around 8am as no queues and no crowds of tourists. This is a must do well worth the money I would recommend the New York pass as it saved us a small fortune.,5.0,4.8256
3423,A spectacular place to visit!,"The Empire State Building is simply amazing. During peak times of the year, the VIP pass is the only way to go. We paid nearly twice the price, but saved at least 3 hours of line waiting by doing so. The museum and 102nd floor observation deck is astounding. This is just a great place to take children, especially if you pay extra to bypass the lines.",5.0,4.9028

The views day and night are contrastley different. Enjoy.,5.0,4.04
3426,Great views,Went here with my three sons and wife after Christmas. Lines were very long but moved pretty fast. Did not buy express but did buy all three floors. Views were great but was very very crowded which did become frustrating. They should sell fewer tickets to make it a little more enjoyable for everyone. Would go again.

3429,Visit to ESB,"This was one of the best attractions we visited while in NYC. It was very interesting with plenty to see on the way up.

Luckily, we had express passes, otherwise we would have had to wait a very long time. The views were spectacular and the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. The only comment I had not to make it 5-stars was a 30-minute wait to get the elevator to get to the 86th floor, so we were able to walk up the 6 flights of stairs to save time, not ideal given I was with an older let too many people in at once so should have cut down on visitors so the elevator wait wasn’t as long.",4.0,4.8544

3443,Must do...!,"Getting tickets for the ESB for the Saturday between Christmas and New Year's is a little out of my usual tolerance of crowds. Buying the Express ticket was worth every penny and made this a very enjoyable experience for my wife and me. The 86th floor observation deck was great, but a little crowded. Didn't take too long to wait for an opening at the fence for us to enjoy the view from all four sides of the deck. We then went to the 102nd floor observation deck, which was less crowded, and an incredible open view with floor to ceiling glass. The ESB is an absolute ""must do"". My only suggestion for improvement would be making the Express lines a little better marked along the way of getting to the elevators, especially near the model of the ESB where you are supposed to go up the left staircase, but it looks blocked off to keep everyone from going up that way. But overall, a very well run operation, keeping the holiday crowds moving along to the appropriate next step in the process.",5.0,4.9396
3444,Awesome,"It was very great, to see New York from the Top of the Empire State Building.

3446,NEW Empire State Building,"Saw that there had been a renovation so booked tickets ahead of time. Decided to do Express. WELL WORTH IT. We still waited outside the building for about 30 minutes to go through Security. After that we had access to the ""red carpet"" lines. You do have to keep asking, however, for the Express lanes. They are marked but it was confusing. Just don't wait in any line. Keep asking so that you get directed to the Express lines, elevators, etc. that you have paid extra for. We were not there when it opened but I would suggest that. AND, do not go to NYC with any young children and strollers over Christmas/New Year's. They don't understand where they are. They won't remember being there. They get tired and cranky. The strollers are a nightmare anywhere in NYC. Five years old and above would be my suggestion. The renovation is VERY well done. It helps a lot with crowd control. Interesting and interactive displays plus walking around outside on two different floors.",4.0,4.709
3447,Red Carpet Treatment,"”Skip the lines” tickets were worth the money! With a limited time in NYC, we didn’t want to spend hours standing and waiting. We received “red carpet” experience skipping ahead of the crowds. All employees were very nice and helpful and patient. The museum was a fun addition. Both kids found interesting and unique souvenirs in the gift shop. The views were of course the highlight! Love the city and it just captures the greatness of New York City!",5.0,4.9428
3448,Queues and dis-organised Chaos,"Entrance is not easy to find as no signs and a very grumpy doorman at one of the other entrances didn't help. The initial queue for the first lift was ok, but the queue for the final lift to floor 86 was ridiculous with everyone crowding into one queue full of queue jumpers and a big lack of staff. Eventually the stairs were opened to deal with the congestion but they invited people from the back of the queue to use them, not the front.",2.0,1.2028
3449,Overall great experience with a couple of exceptions,We enjoyed the experience. But there was lack of clarity in the ticketing process. I had paper printout tickets that did not have a bar code.

Once to the top though, the view, while pretty, was too crowded to actually see much. People pushing and hogging the wall near the actual view made it hard to enjoy. Plus, other than how beautifully historic the building is, the view is similar from top of the Rock and One World Trade Center, so we were a little sky scraper view’d out.",4.0,4.9002

3457,The empire State Building is always worth the ticket!,"The Empire State Building is always worth seeing. However be aware that even though some tickets say ""skip the line"" as mine did, they did not honor the ticket and we STILL had to stand in line, even though we paid more for the ticket and it said ""skip the line "" right on the print out of the ticket",4.0,2.6306

3459,Red Carpet Experience,"I highly recommend buying your tickets months in advance and upgrading to the Express Pass for floors 86 and 102. The lines can grow very long and with the express pass you get skip all of them. You want to visit both floors as well, both have different experiences and the 86th floor tends to be more crowded than the 102, at least in our experience. The elevator stops on the 80th floor where you'll get off to get on another OR take the stairs. We decided to take the stairs from the 80th to the 86th (the only open public stairwell). There's something special about that experience too. Another recommended venture. One more thing, we chose the 4pm time slot. It was winter and the sun would be going down earlier so we thought we'd get the chance to see the city in the daylight as well as sunset. And we were right! It was stunning watching the light throughout the city slowly come to life as the sun sat behind all of NYC.",5.0,4.7762
3460,Superb and well organized with the fast pass,"It was a great visit and everything went smoothly; we barely waited to access the different floors, up to the 102 floor thanks to the fast pass. A bit too crowded on the floor 86th on the outdoor deck though. The view was fantastic but I recommend people to come either early or late in the day; we came around 1:30pm and the sun was facing us when on the south side of the tower; so hard to take pics of south Manhattan with the Liberty tower and so.",5.0,4.8144

3464,"Empire State Building, what a view!","Empire State building, what a view!
I highly recommend the express pass, particularly in holiday season. You can save hours of time waiting and skip all the lines. I would also recommend going to the 102nd floor for the phenomenon of view.",5.0,4.8026
3465,"Poorly organized access to all platforms, no signage, rude staff","We had purchased tickets online with a specific 4h time window yet upon arrival were ushered into the 90 minute-long wait line to go through security and access the Empire State Building where ticket holders and non-ticket holders were queued up - even if you show up 2h before your ticketed time window expires you are bound to miss it, clearly an area for improvement - inside the Empire State Building there was total chaos on the 80th and 86th floors due to the fact that the staff did not give any instructions where to line up for the elevators and when they could not handle the waiting crowds anymore they sent visitors to the staircases - instead of waiting for an elevator for 30 minutes on the 80th floor we would have opted for the stairs right away if there would have been signage/announcements - going up to the 102nd floor was another challenge because there was a large crowed randomly lined up in front of the area where the elevators were - turned out the majority of the people tried to exit the 86th floor not realizing that one line was for the one elevator up to the 102nd floor - and clearly one elevator to go up to the 102nd floor could not handle the number of ticket holders given that we were another 30min in line with only a handful people in front of us - and one was better off not asking for directions because the staff was neither knowledgeable nor friendly - the sunset did not disappoint though!",1.0,4.8098

This is an expensive treat, with waiting lines to be endured. But everyone should do it if they can.",4.0,4.4266000000000005
3470,Wayyyyyyyy too many people allowed in!,"We had “express” as I’d booked on line, which enabled us to skip most of the lines... the line outside, the line inside to security and the lines to the elevator ... and I guess that saved us about 3 hours of standing in line. When we eventually got to the 86thfloor there was about 3 or 4 people deep to the fencing.... it was really disappointing
- we’ve been before so it wasn’t the end of the world...,for those that had spent most of their day getting there they must have been really p’eed off!
The question is why do they let so many people in? Is it just money?
My advice is pay the extra for express, and try to go early to stand the best chance of actually being able to see anything!",3.0,4.6304

The queue for normal admission was crazy around the block and even with the partial skip the line tickets it took over an hour to get to the 82floor. In fact we used the stairs to walk up 6 floors rather than wait an hour for the lift.
Once there there were so many people it almost made it pointless being there
I also wondered about the general safety with so many people on the balconies.
The staff were great under enormous pressure with the holiday crowds.
I had underestimated the number of people at this and all the other mid town attractions which is my fault.
I would suggest thinking carefully about being in New York during the holidays ( which is a shame as it’s such a great town) and if you are here try some of the wonderful walking tours in the Bronx Brooklyn and Harlem where there are no crowds wonderful stories and great history",1.0,4.9002

3488,Skip the line and straight in. Another 'must do' in New York,"I had pre-booked the 'skip the line' ticket upto the 80, 82nd and 102nd floors. I visited at about 8.30 am on Christmas Day (25th December) and it was busy then.

Upon entry I was shown the way via the red carpet 'express route' after my ticket had been scanned in at the gates. Stright to the head of the security queues. As is usual bags were x-rayed and I had to pass through a metal detector archway.

Then a walk through a range of interesting displays about the history of the Empire State Building, before going up in the lift to the 80th floor (indoor) observatory level. A walk around this level gave very interesting views over New York. It was a very clear day and I could see for miles.

Then it was up to the 82nf floor and the 'outdoor' observatory. Foutunately there were space heaters pointing downwards to keep both the staff and visitors wasrm as it was very cold at the time.

The as my ticket permitted, it was up again in the lift to the 102nd floor observatory - wow, what a view. Although the glass to ceiling windows in this small observatory made for a strange experience this high up.

Then back down to the second floor and a tour of the gift shop selling the usual assortment of NYC visitor stuff.

When I emerged from the building at about 9.30am, the queue at this time was going around the block. So I do recommend getting the 'skip the queue' tickets if visiting on a clear Christmas Day morning.

3500,Great experience. Super nice view of the city.,"We were happy with our decision to visit the ESB. Also the insights, little tour was great. We liked it.",5.0,4.7686
3501,Really worth it but usually a queue,It’s sometimes a long wait as we experienced as we wanted to get a night time view. A bit over an hour but enough to see as you queue. Well worth it once you get to the top for these amazing views of New York.,5.0,4.8162
3502,Empire State - Worth the Wait,"Iconic landmark but best entered and viewed at night, with less crowds. As usual with NYC, queues due to poor planning and security are burdensome. Visited using a city pass for both day and night viewing (must be used on the ssme day, day first).",3.0,3.592
3503,Empire brilliance.,It was our 1st time visiting New York & this building was 1 of the many we had on our wish list to visit. We was there for 4 nights & we went to the ESB on our 1st full day (morning) a great experience at 1 of the most iconic buildings in the world. Views of New York are spectacular.. it’s a definite to do whilst in New York. Highly recommend,5.0,4.7864
3504,Not worth the price,Visited on 26th nov which is a couple of days before Thanksgiving and the place was fully packed. The ticket prices were US$46 plus taxes and there was four of us. The queue was too long and it takes you to ride an elevator inly to get into another floor where you’d have to queue up again. When you get to the 86th floor there was another queue to go and look outside. That’s 1.5 hrs of lining up just to go out to the look up area where Meg Ryan finally sees Tom Hanks (from the movie sleepless in Seattle) which is fully packed anyways you can’t even get a decent photo. I think there are better places to spend your money on. It gives you a view of Manhattan but you can do that at the One World Observatory too.,1.0,3.4764
3505,Anniversary trip,This is a great place. We visited at night. It was fabulous. The views were spectacular. My only complaint was the rudeness of people in line at security and elevators. A whole family broke in line between my husband and I at security. Rude . 4 teenage girls broke in line in front of us at elevator. No respect what so ever. Enjoyed the building and scenery.,5.0,4.3364

The official web site informs the visitor/viewer of the pending light-scape for that particular evening. .

3510,Misleading title,There was nothing “Skip The Line” about this experience. The only ticket that allows you to skip the line is the VIP Express. I felt sorry for all of the attendants who were taking the the heat for the people who thought they didn’t have to wait in the line that snaked down the street and around the corner.,1.0,4.1532

We chose to go to the top, 102nd floor. $210 for 2 adults and 1 child. First stop is the 80th floor indoors. 2nd stop is the 86th floor outside. 3rd stop if you pay the extra money is the 102nd floor indoors in the spiral. Having a fear of heights, I should have saved my money. Wall to floor windows, small area to walk, and you can feel the shaking from the wind.

3517,Amazing,I visited the Empire State Building on Christmas Eve during the day and Christmas Day at night. Both times the queues were pretty non existent and it took next to no time to get to the top. The view from the top is one of the best in town. It's also incredible at night. At night I visited the new observation deck. This is a lot smaller but a great view. The only problem with the view from the Empire State Building is that you don't see the iconic Empire State Building. Very highly recommended.,5.0,4.7534

3532,Empire state building,7 of us came to nyc just before christmas..of all the skyscrapers we decided esb was the one to do..its quite expensive to do 86th and 102nd floor..but it was worth it the view is amazing really cold the day we went...be good to do it in warmer weather as well,4.0,4.7958
3533,Double Wow!!,We got tickets for both day and night time. Tickets were easy to buy on line straight from the Empire Building web sight. Think we paid less than $40 each. You must use both same day. It was windy and cold so be prepared. An absolute must see!,4.0,4.4814

3539,Stunning Sunset Experience,"We were really lucky and managed to catch sunset at the very top of the building which was incredible. Top tip, I used google to keep an eye on how busy it was during the day, and then we asked at reception what the queues were like in case it was worth getting the skip the line tickets and were told ‘it’s tops 20 minutes, which is nothing.’ Having saved money thanks to the helpful security guard, we decided to get the tickets to the very top floor instead which were still less expensive than skip the line tickets. The machine in the first foyer only has skip the line tickets which was a lot of money, but if you go ups level you can purchase any tickets from there, and upgrade your standard city pas tickets if you have those.

We entered around 3pm, and by the time we had looked around properly on the observation deck then went to the top the sun was starting to set which was absolutely stunning. Honestly some people say not to bother with the Empire State but I’m so glad we did, and the staff were all very helpful and knowledgeable which was the icing on the cake for us.",5.0,4.976

3549,Paid Extra for Half the Experience,While paying extra for the Express service my family and I were found to be constantly asking staff where to go. We always felt uncomfortable like we were cutting the line not what we expected. There was no signage to direct us.Once we arrived at the 102nd floor elevator area we waited in line as directed by staff for 40 minutes only to find out by another staff member that we should not have. What a state of confusion. The views were fantastic once we got there.,2.0,2.7946

3563,An improved attraction,"This is the second time we have visited The Empire State Building, the first being in 2013. The first time I was fairly underwhelmed. However they have improved the experience before you get to the top with good graphics in the elevator and fun photo opportunities. The security wore uniforms that didn’t fit properly especially the females and so looked a mess and some were pretty arrogant and argued with customers that thought they had been told something which turned out to be wrong. The stairs were opened for the the last few flights inconsistently. There seemed to be no reason when they were opened and closed and this appeared chaotic. The view at the top is spectacular especially on a sunny day, which we had this time time round, but once you have taken your pictures there is no other reason to stay out there.",3.0,3.5234

The majestic view speaks for itself...easy, look out and the beauty and grandeur of NYC is there; but, the people who work there represent that landmark and NYC...that's the shame. Sorry, need to work on just plain being friendly/kind...how about a genuine smile and trying to answer a question without being all attitude. As a group, they laugh and tease all the foreign/tourists with their short, sarcastic remarks. It's ironic that there are stuffed animals and items in the gift shop that represent those in the uniform.",2.0,4.725

Soon as I landed in New York me and my partner went straight to the Empire State Building. It was incredibly pricey considering there’s two separate admissions, no one mentioned this to us when purchasing tickets at the Empire State Building. However everything changed for me on the 102nd floor when I got engaged to the love of my life, my now fiancé tipped and asked a steward to record the engagement and he didn’t he just captures images that aren’t the best. I contacted ESB to see if they would be able to reach out if anyone has this footage or if they would have it themselves however they claimed they can’t.

View is great though!",3.0,4.8518

3611,Great staff and fun exhibits!,"The exhibits on the way to the observation deck, which tell the story of construction and maintenance over the years, are all very well done. Just enough interaction to be fun but without keeping you from heading to the top in good time. The view is incredible of course, and the building is rock solid even in the wind, so don’t let that be a concern. Besides the view, however, the staff is the second best part of the experience, at least during our visit (which was a night around 11pm during the holidays). They were all so friendly, willing answer questions and chat when possible, which was a nice change of pace.",5.0,4.9596

When we returned, each area helped us to go forward. The top floor was closed for some reason on the day we went and our money was gladly returned to us. We were guided by
a worker through the “inside areas” straight to the refund lady who gladly refunded our money. Overall we had a wonderful experience during our visit.",5.0,4.84

Would have been a much better experience if there was signage telling you where to go if you had an express pass. We had to constantly ask the employees where we needed to go and felt like we were walking in endless circles which wasted a lot of time. I will say the views were amazing, the staff were friendly and very helpful but they need to work on creating directional signage.",4.0,4.7376000000000005

3636,One of the most incredible sights in my life,"I went to the top of the Empire state building with my family and it was absolutely amazing. My mom is from New York so we have went back and visited family before but this time it was to show my wife and my in laws. So we did all the ""touristy"" stuff like the statue of liberty, times square etc. But the view from the top is so worth it. I have some photos as well !",5.0,4.9134

It wasn't as clear as to how to purchase your tickets and staff could have been more helpful in that regards.
Heaters were nice to stay warm while outside as the wind cut to the bone.
Would recommend the night view. The King Kong interactive display was fun.",4.0,4.8804

Thanks to the GoExplorer pass we were able to get access early at 7:30am (a special deal they only had in Dec I think) as the sun was rising and it was not crowded. No queues, just pass through security, get the passes scanned and then up the elevator. No way to effectively describe it. It was simply incredible. Really glad to have finally done this and to have paid the extra for the 102nd floor experience. 😊",5.0,4.9597999999999995
3641,Disorganised,"Went here to see the views from 80, 86 and 104 floors. What a farce.

3648,"Great attraction, but need more staff directing people",Experienced a lot of confusion around where you should go if you have a fast pass. There were a number of check points with long lines and no staff directing or instructing where people with fast passes should go. Minimal signage as well. We had to negotiate our way through long queues and find a staff member and tell them we had a fast pass.,4.0,2.5
3649,Well worth the cost of admission,"The Empire State building is a must see attraction while in New York City. While walking and standing next to the building you we feel in awe. The amazing structure is a engineering marvel. While getting your tickets you will have choices on what tour you would like to take between the main deck, 2nd floor museum, skip the line. 102 nd floor, 86th floor and a combination of any. While walking around the inside of the building you can take a picture of a statue of the building standing beside it, read the history of the construction of the building and proceed to the observation deck or tour of your choice. We went around dusk so you could see the city during the daylight and nighttime both are an awesome site to see. Tickets are very accessible while the building was finished in 1931 and stands 102 stories in Midtown Manhattan A must See.",5.0,4.8902

3655,Amazing,"done this attraction on a cold evening, what an experience the views were superb. All the skyline lit up for as far as you could see.
The following day they would not let you out onto the terrace as there were icicles formed on the steel work and was deemed to dangerous to allow people out

We were there on a Saturday and the tickets for the Empire State Building were for the Saturday. I feel the site should not have let me buy the tickets for the meal if the date picked was a Saturday. be careful when ordering, we lost $39 for each meal.",4.0,3.9176
3658,Never Again,The view was beautiful but not worth the wait and the lines. There are very few places to sit and rest and no place to get water from unless you get it prior to standing in line. I paid $93 for an express ticket to avoid waits. I walk with a cane and after all the waiting and getting dehydrated I was almost ready to ask for a paramedic. By the time I reached the 86 th floor I went to the restroom and cupped my hands for water before getting back in line to go to the 102nd. Save your time and money it was not like in the movies at all. Very disappointing,2.0,1.3914

3660,Empire State Rudeness,"The Building & the view are amazing. But some (not all) of the staff were rude, blunt & aggressive. Many of us were shocked by the poor service from such an iconic Building. The Fast Track line wasn't obvious in parts, so we ended up queuing needlessly. We over heard another 2 families being told off by a staff member telling them it was their fault it happened. The staff looked over worked, under paid & they just don't care. The ESB thankfully was the only place in wonderful New York we had such bad service. Management need to sort this as we don't wish to return.",2.0,1.105

3662,"nice experience, a bit expensive for what they offer","I liked the museum at the second floor and the views from 80th, 86th and 102th floors. what I didn't like is how stubborn the staff is at the photo shop desk, they only throw 2 options in the face:
- get two print out (with same background photo) in order to get all the digital other photos!!!
- get one print out and lose the other digital photos.

who is going to get the same print out twice??? and why there is no flexibility?
I paid for the VIP ticket that allows me to do all floors and for the price I paid, at least they could have the decency to include a free photo or free drink and/or pastry.
overrated place, the price is much expensive than what we get in return.",4.0,4.7476

Renovations just done, the museum area, the art pieces, even the elevators (spoiler alert...not your plain everyday elevators) were enough to entertain us and our our 4 and 6 year old grandsons.

There are really no words. Breathtaking views and interesting facts but equally amazing staff. I had a panic attack around floor 30 and thought I’d just sit on the 80th and wait for my kids. The staff would have not hear of it. One usher got someone to cover his post and actually rode from 86 to the 102nd floor so that I could experience the magic alongside my children. That goes way beyond the call of duty and my kids and I will never forget his kindness or that night. Truly special.",5.0,3.749

3677,Top Attraction!!!,We had an early bird access with our New York Explorer Pass. The story of the construction of the empire state building is beautifully portrayed during the passage to the lifts. The King Kong experience is also an added value.

We were there around 11pm and viewed from two separate floors - the lights seemingly went on for miles, as far as the eye could see, it was stunning. We snapped some amazing photos and took our time soaking it in. They also have a lot about the history of the building and the building of it - very interesting.",5.0,4.915

3684,Choose your time carefully,The views are amazing and we went at sunset... So does everyone else! The outside space is quite small but inside the are plenty of windows with great views. No time slots so numbers are not organised. Top of the rock is better for that reason,4.0,4.7184

3687,Night time visit,We has a clear night so we thought here’s our chance. Entrance and trip to the top was fast and efficient. Views were good and you could just about see 🗽.

3688,NYC Honeymoon,"As with anything in New York, we found getting to a venue upon opening to be the best way. We went straight up to the top on an absolutely freezing day. Icicles all over the top of the building and an amazing view of ice topped buildings in Manhattan. You are given an insight into its history and it is incomprehensible that it was built in less than a year.",5.0,4.7916
3689,Wow,"We visited here ona Saturday night and it was amazing. As it was a clear night, the views were spectacular. It didn't take long to get to the viewing platform either - unlike Top of the Rock. We arrived at about 9pm and were able to get in straight away.
I'd recommend going up at night as it's just stunning.",5.0,4.8434
3690,Great experience that you can take your time over,"We went to Empire State at around 15:30 - we were able to go straight I. With no queuing! There is airport style security once you’ve got your ticket it that’s good as it means it’s safe!

The exhibition space is interesting with a good history of how it was built, how it’s been used in movies etc.

We went up to the 86th floor (you go up to the 80th then have a bit of a queue to get another lift to the 86th but you can get goodviews while you are waiting.

We had a good 1.5 hours outside on the 86th - you aren’t rushed at all. We took so long as there was a lovely sunset and we decided to wait for the views once it got dark, which I’m glad we did as the wait was well worth it as the views were spectacular. We could have gone up to 106th floor but that was an extra cost that we didn’t think was worth paying.

Cost for us would have been around $41 but we used one of the attractions on our attraction pass which reduced the overall cost",5.0,4.9764

I really have to say it was amazing and worth the money.

We were lucky enough to go straight up without waiting.
The staff there was overall super friendly and always smiling.
They even answered few questions.

Definitely a must see whilst in NYC. :)",5.0,4.9552
3693,A Must Do If In NYC For The First Time,"We got lucky in the sense that we went on a not so busy day. There was barely any line and we went straight up. We did the 86th floor and the walk through museum. It was very entertaining and informative. Great views of the city. If you can head there before sunset you will get to see the city both during the day and the night.

There will be some people on the street selling passes that let you into multiple attractions. My advice is to avoid purchasing these passes because it didn't really save us any money or time. A flex pass for 2 attractions is $70 per person. The Empire State entry is $38 and most other attractions are $25 or less.

The gift shop is surprisingly affordable considering. So if you want a souvenir, they don't really gouge you as much as they could.

Macy's is just down the street if you want to do some shopping after doing some sightseeing.",5.0,4.9304

3696,A Highlight of a New York City Trip,"During a recent city break to New York City, I visited the iconic Empire State Building. After reading reviews of when to visit, we took heed and opted to go for an early morning weekday visit. I was hoping this would not be too busy and may wife and I would get good views of the city, from one of the taller buildings in NYC. We were not disappointed at all! Inside the attraction there is a great amount of the history of how and when the building was built, which is great if you have to stand in line. Lucky for us, as we went circa 9am on a Monday morning, the ques inside the attraction were light and we managed to enjoy the ambience of the different areas at our own pace. We went for the general admission ticket which takes you up to the 86th floor. This gives a great 360 view of the city, as you are able to walk around the viewing deck and see all aspects of one of the larger cities on the planet. We did not go up to the 102nd floor, as we thought what really would be the difference between the views, apart from being a little higher?? On a clear day you can see for miles across the five boroughs and bridges that make up New York City. As we went up in December the weather was cold at the top, but there are heaters to help take the edge off the coldness, being so high can generate. A great attraction and one well worth visiting.",4.0,4.9784
3697,Got to be done,"Just amazing as a building and the history around it make it very special.

Always some aggressive rocket selling underway in Herald Sq but well worth a visit.",5.0,4.5924
3698,Excellent and quick!!,"Thought it would be really busy so headed down early. Arrived just after 8 o’clock and it was very quiet. No queues at all. Took less than 5 minutes to buy tickets and get through security. We could see by all the railings for queues etc it can get very busy. But arriving early alleviated all of that. Great views. Great experience. All done before 9 o’clock.
Get there early and you’ve got the full day ahead.",5.0,4.8452

3701,Views of New York City,"When in New York, the ESB is a must to visit. It’s iconic for many reasons to many people. The views are stunning. The displays interesting. My only concern was, that on a background of energy efficiency, there are electric heaters on the 86th floor! Mind you it was very cold up there, and I was glad of them.",4.0,4.8082
3702,Incredible!,"People said don't waste your money other skycrapers have great views, but really this is an iconic building and we went just before sunset until dark (you can stay at the top as long as you want and there are heaters - very handy in December) the sun setting over Lower Manhatten and NY lighting up is unfogettable. The staff are so helpful. We paid for the fastpass (we didn't want to wait in -4 degrees queuing) in the end it wasn't busy but it was still worth it for the queues we jumped inside and the time saved on a 4 day trip. If we ever do NY again we would deffo revisit!",5.0,4.8822

3712,Amazing,"It's very easy to read pessimistic information about the Empire State Building, how it's not the the tallest anymore and all that. But the history and the views are astonishing.

3717,Ice - freezing - icicles falling on my head,"We were told that Visibility was terrible and wouldn’t be able to be see anything. We knew it was cold out and I didn’t feel safe as it was supposed to be icy. So we asked for our money back. We were told that we could not get her money back because we bought the tickets online from the Empire State building. They told us we could go tomorrow but we were leaving at seven that evening and could not go the next day.if we bought the tickets in the building, we could get a refund which does not make sense to me. It Was freezing upstairs icicles everywhere even hitting you on the head and the floor was slippery there were no people except a handful.",1.0,1.9154
3718,Empire State at night,"We had gone earlier in the day, it was rather foggy and a great assistant gave great advice and said for us to not waste our time as there was no view. She said to call later or first thing in the morning and someone would answer to advise if there was a view.
We later went to a bar (which over looked the Empire State) and we saw it had cleared up. We decide to go around 6:30pm and we had the New York explore city pass, we decided to do the top of $21 to go to the 102 floor too. Queues weren’t too bad, 15/20mins wait. The view from the 102 floor was phenomenal. Worth it. Overall very stress free experience.",5.0,4.7124

3720,Iconic attraction,"One of those buildings you just have to visit.
We visited early morning and avoid queuing for to long and security check wasn't bad either.
The history that is told as you wander through to the lifts is interesting. Some of displays have been updated since I last visited.
Good views fom the top but this will depend on the weather. Need to be wrapped up when visitng in winter.",5.0,4.2798

3722,Attraction,"Great views, worth a visit.
Included in the New York pass, works out a lot cheaper than paying at the door.",5.0,4.4368
3723,The best view of New York,"The views from the 102th floor are simply spectacular. The new 80th floor observatory shows in a very creative way the history of this iconic building. Being located at the center of Manhattan, you can't get a better experience of the city sky line.",5.0,3.3982
3724,An afternoon delight (and money grab),"It’s been 15 years since I visited and the experience has really improved (and I thought it was great on my last visit). The experience leading up to the observation levels was great, keeping the kids entertained all the way through. I recommend going in the afternoon - we barely had to wait in line. I had to mark down the experience because we used our Go NY explorer passes on this attraction but the Empire State wanted an additional US$30 each for us to go up to the highest level, which wasn’t declared anywhere and we thought that was pretty unfair. The Empire State Building may no longer be the tallest building in NYC, but it was groundbreaking at the time and a must see.",4.0,4.635
3725,"Foggy day, but still a fun day","It was a actually a raining day. People there were very nice and kept reminding us that the visibility was zero before we purchased tickets. Once I got to the level 86, some folks would try to describe what it would look like in a sunny day. In 80th floors, the exhibition and King Kong are pretty funny :) I enjoyed my visit.",5.0,4.9062
3726,Still the most iconic view of NY,Go early and on a clear day to the 106th floor for the best 360 degree views of the city. Great value on the NY Pass too. Very courteous staff.,5.0,4.9018

3728,Loved the Empire State Building,We just bought the ticket to the 86th floor which let us go out on the balcony and see the city in lights! It was amazing!!,5.0,4.3768
3729,Out of this world experience,"The Empire states building has been on my bucket list since I was a kid and read about it in my history book under the tallest buildings of the world. At that time, the twin towers had already surpassed it in height but there was something about the photo that I saw that made it my fav skyscraper. Visiting it was a dream come true and I loved the fact that I went on the top at night and saw the city shining like a spread of gems and jewels. The experience of climbing to the top can be a little overwhelming with multiple elevators and narrow spaces with multitudes of people in the line but the view from the top is surely worth it.
Travel date: may 2016",5.0,4.9756
3730,Empire State Building,The trip was fun..not much waiting or walking. The museum aspect of it was interesting and informative. Definitely made the experience better. It was a little crowded on the 86th floor but that is expected.,5.0,4.1294

3734,Must see in NY,"I loved it. On a rainy day, the guide said to us, that there was no view, ""if you have the possibility, come back later or another day."" They were really honest und helpful. There were heatings everywhere, so it was very, very cold, but you could warm up and go again outside.",5.0,4.498

3737,AWESOME,We got on top right before sunset so got pix with daylight and 30 min later city at night - absolut amazing view. And they improved the process to get on top - at least we had to wait half the time compared to the last visits.,5.0,4.7181999999999995
3738,Shockingly overbooked,Had a very bad experience of the attraction. Too many people allowed in resulting in my mother missing out on going up the lift as she is chlostrophobic and had a panic attack when they tried to cram us all into the lift. Once the rest of us were up top we were told it was a 45 minute wait to get the lift to the observatory part. So we were advised to use the stairs... 6 floors up we had to trot which was also rammed. Then too many people on the deck couldn't see a thing. Set off back down and was told to use the stairs yet again. Absolute joke the whole experience.,2.0,1.4998

3742,New York Skyline at its best,"Fantastic. Little bit of patience required to get to observatory, now with the crowd numbers and the inevitable security check. Worth going up to 102 and paying a little extra for the privilege to have an unencumbered view of the skyline and floor to ceiling windows rather than looking through the wire grille on the open-air observation deck on 86th floor. If you have never been you have to go and if you have been before, worth a second visit.",4.0,4.7668

3745,Amazing,We had a New York pass which we used for this attraction. We went up at 08:15 so it was pretty quiet & straight forward getting tickets to go to the top. My only disappointment would be that you have to pay extra to go to floor 102 right at the very top which we didn’t do. The views were still amazing though & there was plenty of information regarding how this was built which was interesting. The weather was lovely & clear when we went up & there are fixed binoculars at various points too,4.0,4.9242
3746,What a view,"Recently visited New York and the view and experience from the top of the Empire State was awesome. The staff we excellent as the first day we tried to go up they advised against it due to cloud cover. Whilst extremely busy you could stay there for as long as you wanted, with heaters on to keep the chill off you.",5.0,4.725

3751,Dismay because of weather,"It was a nice iconic place to visit. However, it was a let down as there was a lot of fog/mist and we couldn’t see much as most of the city was not visible. I felt that Empire State Building should not charge when visibility is next to zero",3.0,3.843
3752,Too expensive,Everything is changed. The security with the family ( two kids 2 years old and 5 years old with one stroller) was a nightmare. No patience at all. We made the picture and pay $26 dollars without the opportunity to change the one we prefer. We have to spend $36 dollars to have the digital pictures and we say no too much! Now we have a pic with a view by night and without the Empire. Had 4 Picture made on the Empire and this is the worst that we had. So sad cause it should be a beautiful memories with our children.,2.0,1.3534

One of our party would not have coped with the very long queues so we upgraded to the fast-Track tickets. It seemed expensive at the time but soooo worth it as we sped past all those queues. If you can afford the upgrade, do it. We didn’t bother with new 102 flor viewing as this was another $30 per person and we’d maxed out on this sight. But definitely worth a visit.",5.0,4.798

3787,Interesting little history lesson and a great view,We saw the night view from the 86th floor. We paid for the skip the line entrance and there really wasn't anyone there when we went so that ticket wasn't beneficial at the time. It also was too cold for me to stay outside to take photos. I did like the way the skyline was labeled and the building itself is very pretty. Visitors to NYC should really get to see this view and building. Highly recommend taking the time to see the building and view. Not much else really in the building though to see.,4.0,4.4982

3789,Great view AND entertaining journey through the history of the empire state building,"I was on empire state building in 2003 the last time and am glad I visited again this year 2019. We visited at night about 11.30 pm on a Sunday, which I can totally recommend, as we had no lines at all! On your way to the top we were entertained by many pictures of the history, movie screens which have you the feeling you watched the workers build the building years ago. Even king Kong was visiting ;)
This spot is a place in NYC you must have visited absolutely!!!",5.0,4.7848
3790,Clear views,"Visited here whilst on a recent trip to the city. We pre booked our tickets to allow entry between 8am-12. We arrived at around 08.30 hours and it was thankfully quite quiet at this time. We were quickly through security and on our way up to the first port of call the 86th floor. It was a lovely bright day so we had good clear views out over Manhatten. We did have to wait a short time to get the lift up to the 102nd floor but nothing major. Once on top we were able to go out onto the open deck. We did find it quite breezy up here but this didnt hinder the views we were able to take in and enjoy.

This was an enjoyable experience and I would definitely visit again if visiting the city. I didnt feel at the time we visited the extra cost to que jump was necessary but I guess during peak times that might cut out the waiting time if on a tight schedule.",5.0,4.9326
3791,Buy express!!!,"I cannot emphasize the express pass enough. It is very expensive (doubles your ticket price), but it is worth it. They treat you like Kings and Queens with Express. You just show your bracelet and everything from security to elevator rides you take priority. We got there about 40 mins before sunset and waited for a while in the line before switching to express. From the time we made our decision to go express to being out on the viewing area (including buying the tickets) was probably 10 minutes max. We would have been in the line for over an hour more regular pass. The views are great and if you can go just before sunset you can see all 3 phases. Recommend this once while in New York if you like city skyline views.

Also if you get Express don't worry about the ""museum"". We went up top first and then tried to see the museum afterwards and it was confusing to get there and you saw the horrible crowd of people making you grateful you bought express.",4.0,4.958
3792,First visit to the Empire State Building,"First timer and it was spectacular! We enjoyed the museum before going outside for the view. The view over NYC was amazing and although very crowded, you could still make your way to the wall/ guardrails. We arrived around 3:30pm in December and made it outside just in time for daylight, the sunset and the night view so that's a perfect time to arrive.",5.0,4.8152
3793,Great View,"We visited the city from Connecticut and spent time sightseeing with my niece and her family. They took us to the Empire State Building which I had never been to in my 75 years on earth. It was fabulous. We went on a Monday, so it wasn't very crowded. All the employees do a great job and the view is outstanding. Glad i finally got to go there.",5.0,4.8764
3794,"Cloudy day,not much for 200 dollars.",I didn't think this was worth the money when you consider top of the rock is less than half this price.shoukd be a refund if no visibility at the very top.,3.0,3.6364
3795,It was a breath taking view.,"I went with a nine year old, a teen and two adults. If I would change anything we did to make it a better visit, I would recommend getting the express. The lines where crazy busy and waiting in line was a chore, so spending the extra money would be worth it. Overall, it was an amazing visit and a breath taking view. There is nothing more astonishing in the big apple then looking from the top of the Empire State Building.",5.0,4.7181999999999995
3796,Bit pricey,"Decided to visit this attraction. Went early to avoid queues. We paid to go to 102 floor, lovely views. All staff were polite and very well organised. Good range of items in gift shop. Overall, I personally think this attraction is over priced considering there are much taller venues now. We paid over $180 for 3 of us",3.0,4.9041999999999994
3797,Great at night,"One of the N.Y.C. “Must do’s”. We went up in the evening after dark and it’s was amazing. Also, evening viewing meant no queue and plenty of space to view the city. It’s expensive but if you have a NY pass then it’s a must do. Takes about an hour or two. Very worth while and something you’ll remember doing and tell others about.",5.0,4.1116
3798,Must see view!,The best view in NYC! This is an iconic building that is a must see in your life time! Girls trip to New York was complete with this experience!,5.0,4.4498
3799,New experience is fun but cost is high!,"I visited the ESB 2 years ago with one daughter and just this past Sunday with another - it is definitely a better experience- easier to follow the history of the building - the new King Kong interactive was ok - liked the section on the workers! Although the views at 102nd floor are great, it is hard to know what you are seeing - they need better signage for that - would be nice to know what different buildings and landmarks you can see - the Observation deck in Chicago would be a good model to follow!
Price is prohibitive for families.",4.0,4.9516
3800,Amazing,"We visited late about midnight and it was amazing. My daughter had visited the night before but said it was foggy- when we went it was so clear. It’s a surreal experience, the silent calm air above a metropolis of noise, action and non stop action. It was a wonderful experience, I also visited one world trade but preferred this because you stand outside. I put my hand over the edge and it was an eerie feeling. Well organised, a beautiful building with a fascinating story. Deffo worth the visit.",5.0,4.9698
3801,Night time,Go after 8 pm. No wait and views are amazing. From all directions the views are great. I recommend going to the top floor,5.0,4.75

Everyone who works here is very friendly and helpful. This was my second visit and my friend's first. Both of us had a great time.,5.0,4.9486
3803,Wonderful history lesson,"The elevator operator ""Greg"" on the 102nd floor was exceptional!!! He spent time pointing out landmarks and giving tidbits of history. He was so friendly and helpful-his input was the highlight of our NY trip. Well worth the time and money.",5.0,4.8302

3810,visit of the empire state building,"My visit of the empire state building was perfect. The view was wonderful
I hope I will come back soon",5.0,4.7668
3811,Empire State Renovation is Amazing,We purchased the skip the line timed ticket to see the newly renovated Empire State Building. The extra $ was worth it. We were able to get on the elevator ahead of a lot of other tourists. The exhibits are tastefully presented. There is so much NYC history in this building. There are many opportunities for photos including a great King Kong video. It was a very windy day so we did not stay out on the observation deck for too long but the views were amazing. Due to the weather we did not go to the very top which requires an additional ticket. Time of stay depends on the crowd and how much you are interested in looking at the photos and reading the information.,5.0,4.89
3812,Breathtaking,Although many lines to get to the 86 floor it was truly an amazing sight. I truly enjoy the breathtaking views at one point I was breaking a tear because I miss my town so much.,5.0,4.8236

it was wonderful to stay in the city par excellence",5.0,4.6213999999999995
3814,Magical Experience,It was a chilly December afternoon but the sky was clear and the sun was shining and it made for a magical experience viewing Manhattan and the surrounding boroughs from the outdoor observation deck 86 floors above the city. Nothing beats the view from the Empire State Building and it was so quiet the noise from the streets below could barely be heard,5.0,3.0
3815,Great views.,"So much better than top of the rock. Less Queing, better pictures, easy to get a good view of the city.",5.0,4.8358
3816,Amazing views!!!,I visited this as my first sightseeing spot! It is awesome to be at the top and experience the night views!! Wasnt a line at night so i recommend that!!,5.0,4.7672
3817,Impressive but expensive for what it is,"Myself and my partner went up to the viewing area in the Empire State Building whilst visiting New York. It is one of the things to tick off the list as we are glad we went, but for what it is, the price is pretty extortionate!",3.0,4.5288
3818,Great organization,"Great organization. My daughter-in-law and I had a great visit to the Empire State building! The staff was courteous, efficient, and they were moved a lot of people through very quickly! We were able to see all the floors available and it was really fantastic.",5.0,4.9254
3819,Great experience!,"Don't miss it! The exhibition floors were a fantastic introduction to the history of the Empire State Building. We visited on a Sunday morning and were astonished that there were not too many people. Great weather and therefore fantastic views. Due to queues before the lifts to the 86th floor, we were allowed to walk up and down the last floors. Great experience. And coming down, we went to see the Christmas tree in the foyer. Fantastic!",5.0,4.9478
3820,a lot of things to do,"what I liked best about this building: there was more to do than just go up and see the view. Plenty of photo opps (Our fav: the one with King Kong!). Even the ride on the elevators were entertaining, with the video projections on the floor and ceiling.

We went up during the day, during the week and the lines were relatively short. No lines at security or to get tickets. (Happy we didn't get the VIP pass.) The views were spectacular as we expected. Appreciated all the telescopes as well.

yes it's cold outside but the heaters there made it bearable.

If I went back, I would do so at night. The photos look amazing.",4.0,4.8758
3821,Brilliant,2nd time I’ve visited first was 2002 then again this December and it was so much better than I remember,5.0,3.9804
3822,Empire prices at Empire State Building,"Be prepared to wait in lines, lines and more lines. It has become very Disneyish. I have been there before but it’s been a few years and things have changed. Prices have gone up and there are many different packages now, each one higher than the other. The view is fantastic though and we saved some money by not going all the way up. We went on a Saturday in December so the lines were long. They take your photo at the beginning and then try to sell it for $36! It’s a shame, for $10 I bet more people would buy it. If you’ve never went up the ESB before, it is something to see.",4.0,4.469
3823,"Great views, but a bit too crowdy.","It is my, don´t know, 4th or 5th time there. I always find amazing the views. And that´s way like to come back again.
But every time is more and more crowdy, which is pretty umconfortable, even if You have paid fast track tickets.",4.0,4.6302
3824,A must do experience for NYC.,"I did like other people had suggested and went on a Tuesday around 11AM. I did the online purchase of the ticket. And it was really smooth with the ticketbarcode scanned at the turnstyle. There isn't even any human involvement in the process. You bypass the ticket kiosk and info desk and go right to the 2nd level. You do go through security. I heard rumors of them not letting in ham radios. But I just put my radios out in the open. I then presented my phone at the turnstyle to the reader and it let me in. Then it was a short wait at the elevator. Your first experience is a very well done history of the building. Photos, dioramas, plans, and artifacts. You wind up at one of the many elevators and take the ride up with a usual silly video playing in the ceiling. ""are we going to get up enough speed to break through the glass ceiling?"" You stop at 80th floor for an interesting produced experience. Curtiss F8C-5/O2C-1 Helldivers fly around shooting at the over sized simian who is climbing the building. You can sit in a big life-size hand. You then go around and get a good view from the 80th with period windows, window sills, period office equipment, and other immersive stuff. Then you take your second elevator ride to the 86th obs deck. This is where most people get their selfies. A crowded place even at light times because people spend a lot of time. This space was recently improved the most by removal of obstructions.",5.0,4.936
3825,A classic,"I had a great time here, it is fascinating to say the least. If you go in winter as I did I really recommend going near dusk so you get spectacular views as the sun sets and then all the towers start to light up which is brilliant.
Be warned it is cold up there!",4.0,4.8488

3828,Christmas Visit to NYC,"Empire State Building tour was great, learned many things about this grand building... well done, plenty of assistance and well informed guides.",5.0,4.7914
3829,Good views and a fun experience,"There were multiple things to keep you occupied as you worked your way through the building; from the laughter and pictures of King Kong to the distances to different places. Once At the top the views were amazing. The structure and history behind it all are amazing as well. I would definitely recommend. One thing to add, as you walk through Times Square you will have people shout at you stating they have skip the line tickets and that the queues for tickets are hours long etc. Ignore them. We did and there was literally no queue and we walked straight through. It was busy, as you expect these things to be, but not as busy as they will try to make out.",4.0,4.6402
3830,Another Tourist Trap that Needs Planning,"We had a decision to make with here or the Rockefeller Centre.
The entrance was confusing, lots of people wandering around not knowing where to go to buy or just collect tickets.
Nothing externally or internally warns you about the time it takes to go through the various rooms to get the full experience. As it was a December visit, daylight was at a premium, and unfortunately, between entering the building, buying the tickets and taking in the full experience, by the time we got to the top, the cloud had come in and reduced visibility substantially.
You will need to allow around 2 hours for the full experience before going up in the lifts. This may need a lot longer on busier days if you want to take pictures at each photograph opportunity.
If going again I would allow a full half day and ensure the weather was good.",3.0,4.6352
3831,A highlight!,"I would recommend highly getting the skip the lines pass! It was so easy and the staff was so gracious! The views were phenomenal and the entire experience, so educational! My 8 year old grandson loved it as well!!",5.0,4.917
3832,Up to the top,"Excellent views on a clear day
Interesting history on the building as you walk around the lower floors
Interesting journey in the lift up to the 86th floor which has great views of NY, then if you have purchased the top ticket then up to the 102 nd floor
Best to do Empire State during the day then if you do rockerfella at night you have a better idea of what your looking at.",4.0,4.9404
3833,Terrible organisation,"The organisation of the queues was terrible, even the staff didnt know what was going on or which queue anyone should be in. You have to take the elevator to the 80th floor, then queue again to get in the elevator for the 86th floor (which is what your ticket is for). Compared to Top of the Rock which seamless, this was a dreadful experience.We ended up walking 6 flight up and down between the 80th an 86th floors to avoid the chaos.",2.0,1.2442
3834,A must visit place,"A must visit place! The weather was so-so and there were NO LINES. There was not a need to spend any extra money on extra ticket stuff. Seriously - no lines. The elevator is fast - people were nice and the views were hit and his because of the weather. Here is the caveat to the visitor - buy the basic picture package and no more. My wife and I got the ""Deluxe"" and got screwed. The website does not work and via REPEATED emails it is obvious that the company doing the pictures are only in it for the money and they suck.

3837,Schedule and go first thing in morning! “Early bird gets the worm!”,"We walked to it at 7:30am and had prepaid tickets good for between 8-noon. We walked into lobby and joined lines in progress thru security, the museum portion and the up elevators pretty quickly even though it was busy! We went to first level at 86th floor. Stunning but cold - not minding we took a lot of photos. Then we again boarded an elevator to the top - 102nd floor - newly remodeled. And enclosed with huge windows!! When we left we looked thru a great gift shop and when exiting noticed lines were outside the building. We came by around noon and it was lined for several blocks outside in the cold!! Advice go early!! But definitely go!",5.0,4.9528
3838,The original and best tower to visit in NYC,"We had some bad customer service experiences around the stores in new york and wanted to call in to the entrance of the Empire State to ask a question. The person inside just before the ticket office was lovely. Very helpful, gave us advice on our visit and was a pleasure to talk to. We went for sunset later, made it on time (although if you stay for all the extra pre stuff like photo gimmic thing, displays, videos you will be there an extra 30 mins) so we just headed straight for the lifts and took lots of photos. I love the architecture inside and out.",5.0,4.8804

3844,"It's OK, but Top of The Rock is better","It's expensive, and the views are good. But the top is too small for the numbers of people involved and the safety fencing gets in the way of photographs. It reminds me of the top of the Eiffel Tower, where everyone jostles for the best view / photo spot and then comes away frazzled and mildly traumatised. It didn't help that our visit was on a warm October day, but someone had the (not so) good idea of turning on electric patio heaters which made it uncomfortably hot.

Go to the Top of The Rock instead - it's much better.",3.0,4.8876

There are free binocular viewers that have guided that allow to easily identify NYC landmarks. It can be breezy up there so go prepared. I could definitely feel some movement while inside. I expedite slight vertigo type feeling, so be prepared for that as well. Pictures from the top are nice but there's no way to get the total experience from photos. Take the trip.

There is quite a bit about the building documented early in the tour. You'll also be approached by a photographer who will take your photo, which will be available as you leave. Go ahead and have the photo taken, then decide if you want it. Doesn't cost anything see the result.",4.0,4.9604

3875,Just a Good Experience,I recently visited the Empire State building after purchasing a Groupon ticket. I want anyone reading this before buying there ticket to not spend a whole lot on skip the line and extra to go up higher. Pay the cheapest price and they will let you go all the way up. It was a bit confusing (if it’s your first time) when getting there because you don’t see a worker at the bottom so you have to guide yourself. Until you get to security then they check your tickets. After you take an elevator to the first stop. You get out walk around then you get back in the elevator and it takes you to the outside view. The weather was cold and windy. But they had heaters out to keep you warm. We experience a very nice and helpful guy working up there he even took a picture with us. Maybe we went at a good time and there was no line. (Sunday Night) Everyone seemed confused and just followed each other. I wouldn’t say it was the best experience but it also wasn’t a terrible experience. I think I’d prefer to go during the day and not night.,4.0,4.7974

I also think that it's completely wrong to put together the people who have the tickets and the ones who want to buy them. They should be in different lines!

3885,"Nice views, OK value","This will provide some really nice views of NYC especially on a clear day. I went to the ESB about 10 years ago and the have greatly improved the experience. I do however still feel it’s a little overpriced for what you are getting. If it was about $20-$25 less for the total experience including the 102nd floor, I would have given it 5 stars. In contrast, the 9-11 memorial and Statue of Liberty gives a much better value at a much lower price.",4.0,4.8838

Your staff were all very polite, friendly and helpful . The building was spotless and very welcoming and had lovely photo opportunities with the small structures on way up to the lift.

3891,Much improved!,"I went on this tour 5 years ago and in comparison, its so much better. I honestly was dreading the long lines as we went during Thanksgiving. Go earlier in the day as we did not wait in line at 10:30am. They have it so that you walk through the museum as part of a moving line. You can skip through that if you just want to go up to the top. They elevator you to near the top. You have the option to either switch elevators for the last 6 floors or walk up the stairs. We did the stairs and it was fast. The top deck is packed but they have heaters and bathrooms so you can spend as much time as you want. We took the stairs down and then the long elevator and it took us 10 min to leave at 1pm.

3908,lack of information,"We visited one morning in order to book tickets for that evening in the hope of catching sunset. The queue was pretty long but we bypassed this as our New York Pass stated we could skip the line. This was not the case and we were sent to the back. When we finally got to the ticketing screens (no actual people) we couldn't find what we wanted so managed to catch the one person that seemed to be there to help people out. He just pointed out another queue that we should join. After another half an hour, we realised that there was no ticket desk, so jumped out of this queue so leave as we had other things booked. We finally found 2 really helpful members of staff who told that we we couldn't pre-book for an allotted time (as Top of the Rock and most other places do) so would just have to come back later and queue. We arrived at 3.30pm and we just about made it to the top for sundown at 4.30pm, but only with a pass to skip the initial queue and go straight to the security check gate. It was packed, I hate to think what what happen in a fire, but the view of course was stunning and worth the wait.

3931,Feel like I was conned,"Someone was by the door looking at the pre-booked tickets and they just said you need to go through security and go through the ticket machines. We queued through security and went to place our tickets to scan and the guard immediately said that the tickets were not valid there. It was a city pass which was suppose to have the Empire State included. We were made to feel like an inconvenience if we wanted to go back down and leave so we felt obliged to pay almost $90 for the two floors. What made it worse is the staff were incredibly rude, and many people were having the same problem!
For those who want to know what it’s like whilst up there, it isn’t actually anything special. We had the same sort of view from our hotel! There was nothing much to do whilst up there other than look at the view. Is definitely not worth paying for unless you have the pass and hopefully they will let you use it!

It was cloudy, but luckily visibility was good enough to see the city and surrounding areas. Everything was so well organized and the employees were very helpful. The gift shop had many items to choose from and some shirts marked down that we liked.

It would be well worth the extra money though if you were going earlier in the day.

It is busy so you may need to wait to get the the edge to take photos. Warning for those purchasing a none vip ticket- the queues are massive. VIP is worth saving you hours queuing during the day.
The museum although having a fun King Kong room - is not what I would consider a museum about the building. There is some art work creations and videos, images from movies and pics of celebrities that have been there... I was expecting to see maybe bolts and tools used and lots of original photos...but was disappointed to have one room with lots of text on the walls and the rest more like an art and celebrity exhibit. King king room was cool but so over crowded I couldn’t get a photo without 20 people in the shot.",3.0,4.6644000000000005

However, most (not all) of the staff were very short in terms of how they treated you and acted like they would rather be a 100 other places then where they were working. I know they have to deal with a ton of guests (many foreign) but it doesn't mean you have to be a smart ass or rude. Go work somewhere else if you don't want to be there.",4.0,2.0254
3986,Overpriced,Great views but $260 for 4 people is extortionate. We went to 86th and 102nd floors. I wouldn’t bother with 102nd floor - not a huge difference in the views and it’s very small and crowded,2.0,2.0848
3987,empire state building,Our 10 year old grandson absolutely enjoyed this. Fabulous exhibit on 2nd floor and then head up to the top. Awesome!!!,5.0,4.8806

3990,Empire State,Amazing views of the city. Go early to avoid the hordes of people and long queues. The exhibition showing the construction process and the amazing engineering feat is insightful,4.0,4.5012
3991,A mother of a kid with a wheelchair.,"We were visiting for a weekend trip. On this trip, we have met some very unfriendly people but The staff here was AMAZING! My child was in a wheelchair and was treated great as well as our family staying together. Thank you, thank you, thank you!",5.0,4.9554
3992,Observation deck and 108th floor,"Went in the evening, no queues and straight in. Viewing platform was heated, which was very much appreciated as it was bitterly cold. 108 floor was ok but you get better pictures from outside.",5.0,4.3594
3993,Beautiful Building with original Art Deco features,"Everyone wants to see the view from the top but the journey through the building is also special. Take time to look at the mother of Pearl floor inlay; the Art Deco lifts and marble features. It is more expensive to get a skip the line ticket but if it’s busy, well worth it. You get priority line express up and down the visit. I’d say go at twilight so you get to see the views and also the lights.",4.0,4.6762
3994,It was awesome!,"Great memories of my childhood seeing it again as an adult!!! I did skip the line and paid more, also included the 80th, 86th and 102nd floor! Spectacular views!",5.0,4.481
3995,Must do,"This is a must if you visit New York. Arriving before sunset is amazing seeing NYC in the day then watching the sun go down and the city light up is something you’ll never forget.
Buy your tickets before you go. Loads of places online have offers then you won’t have to queue for ages to buy tickets.",5.0,4.3338
3996,It was PERFECT!,"This was a first for the three of us and we were not disappointed. Everything was exactly what we wanted it to be. The self guided audio tour was great and all the displays made it easy to learn about the history and get a good orientation to what we were looking at. Love it! We had the tickets that included the museum, and both top floor viewing areas.",5.0,4.9136
3997,Trip to New York City,Our City offered a bus trip to New York . What a wonderful time of the year to take my daughter and 2 grandgirls to New York. They are 11 and 13 and have never been. Our first stop was the Empire State Building. I have not been there in 10 years and was surprised by all the improvements . It was a remarkable experience for them and one I don't think they will ever forget.,5.0,4.6251999999999995
3998,The Lights of New York,"The Empire State Experience was incredible. Go early evening, just as it's getting dark and see the city light up. Just so beautiful. Would go again and again and again.",5.0,4.4354
3999,Absolutely Brilliant,"This is a visit consisting of everything you want and more from such a major landmark. Staff are great, the site is very informative and the views are spectacular. I would visit early (8-9am) if you can as we found it was less busy for us. Doesn’t disappoint at all.",5.0,3.9176
4000,A New York must!,You can’t go to New York and not go up one of its buildings that it’s so well know for. Lovely views of the city at the top and the museum is great too.,4.0,4.8178
4001,Better than ever.,"Toured it years ago and again in August. It's so much improved. A wonderful exhibit of the skywalkers that give you a realistic appreciation for the folks who built these buildings. A smooth ride to the top and the night we visited there was a full moon to enhance the quiet beauty of the city. An awesome stop for us. Oh yeah, and we arrived in a rickshaw (?) to boot. Cool night.",5.0,4.9414
4002,"Fun evening, but not great",The Views were spectacular- lots of great pics! I thought they were going to do more with the second floor with the films that have been done there. That part was disappointing. Would also suggest some way of letting visitors know what they are looking at. That would add to the enjoyment,3.0,4.3992
4003,Inefficient processes,Why would you put people with and without tickets in the same line? Why would you put people wanting to exit and people going up to the top floor in the same line? Who organized your procedures? They were poorly designed.,1.0,3.654
4004,Empire State Building,"Hi, this is a must see during the day for 360 degree views of the city. We sprung for express tickets which made it easy and very enjoyable. This was a big expense for our five person family but we’ll worth it. The staff was helpful, pointing out what we were looking at, the different bridges and buildings, when we asked.",5.0,4.6882
4005,ONE AND DONE....Not worth time or money,Lines were incredibly long. You go from one line to another holding area of another line several times. We waited in lines approximately 2.5 hours and spent probably 20 minutes on the observatory deck. We did go on up to the 102nd floor which was less congested because it cost an extra $25. The worker here was nice and even offered to take our picture. The rest of the workers seemed overwhelmed and herding people through rudely like cattle. We wanted the experience but it's a one and done experience.,2.0,3.331
4006,Spectacular Viewing,Traveled from California to visit the Empire State Building... It was definitely worth the extra money paid to purchase the EXPRESS Ticket. It was a Crystal Clear evening and breathtaking Skylines...THANK YOU!!!,5.0,4.7544
4007,Long lines - not worth the wait,"We waited in line for almost an hour, staff were not very friendly, although some staff were very nice. I did this same visit 7 years ago, and found it much more pleasant then.",3.0,4.183
4008,A Classic must-see for New York visitors ... and wheelchair accessible,"The Empire State Building has featured in movies, and they made good use of this in the pre-lift side-shows to amuse the queues ... though when we visited in the evening, there were no queues and we breezed through. My wife in her wheelchair had no problems getting round the pre-lift shows and the ride up in the fast lift. From the top viewing deck we could see skyscrapers all around, and it was evident that this was no longer the tallest building in New York; but it is still the Classic must-see for visitors.",5.0,2.7692
4009,Pleasant visit,"Our visit was very pleasant. Easy access, beautiful view of the city day and night. I will always go back",5.0,4.7854
4010,Top Notch Rock Tour,Tour guide was very knowledgeable of history. Learned things about the Rockefeller family that I never knew. Tour guide was also witty. December in NYC is CRAZY. Nothing that was going on around us seemed to interfere our tour experience as our guide helped navigate us through while remaining very calm.,5.0,2.7237999999999998
4011,Fun,it was a great experience to see the view from the ESB. But it was very crowded and therefore tiring.,4.0,3.7432
4012,The Best Experience of My Life,Got Engaged 108 Stories about NYC and I couldn't be happier with the staff and everyone at the Empire State Building.,5.0,2.9608
4013,View from the sky,Warm welcome at the reception provided the right ambience for the visit. Audio visual displays on the history and making of the ESB was worth watching them for a while before going to the 86th floor. View from the top was simply amazing!,4.0,4.7864
4014,Poor Process - Great exhibit and Views,"We ordered express passes and the new viewing area on 106 on line. When we got there we had great difficulty with getting the correct tickets because the codes on the printout didn't match what was in the system. It took staff actually READING the printout to give us the correct passes. That was not quick or easy. In addition, the express line takes you around the exhibit on the 2nd floor so that if you didn't know to ask about it, you would miss it entirely. The signage is terrible. Once you find the exhibit, it's great and the views are always wonderful. Seriously, someone needs to fix the process. You charge enough money. The experience should be delightful and it is not.",3.0,4.6346
4015,Under the stars!,"I planned an evening trip to the Empire State Building to top off my son's first visit to NYC. It was perfect! We were blessed with a clear night and chilly temps.
The exhibits leading up to the ""finale"" were excellent and a worthwhile view, while navigating the lines. Despite the crowds, lines move quickly and the wait is totally worth it.",5.0,4.9234
4016,Perfect experience,It was perfect! An excellent experience! My sister and I are so glad to have met the empire and the personal who work there is really nice and helpfull.,5.0,4.8854
4017,Another excellent experience,"I've been many times, but one of my friends had never visited, we bought the express tickets and they worked like a dream, we visited on Saturday 7th of December, and the queue was down the street. With the express ticket we simply bypassed a very long line, it really is worth it. The vues from the top are always something else!",5.0,4.8688
4018,1 Hour wait in line for the first elevator-102nd Worth it!,"The line for the first elevator was so long it took us one hour to get through. It would have been nice to see signs that said ""your are 30 minutes away from the elevator, etc, or even a sign that read the bathroom is this way. Seats would have been nice for the handicap people, only saw one bench for three people. The lady on the 80th floor on Saturday 12/7/2019 at about 3:30pm was so rude to me. The staff on the 102nd floor were amazing and so was the view. Also, there was not enough direction on what to do and where to go...everybody seem confused. Not enough signs.",5.0,3.9992
4019,Life at the top,"We decided to visit both viewing floors whilst in NY. The building has an organised queuing system and we were not kept waiting too long. The elevator has a great short film shown on the roof as you move up the floors. The security although extensive is reassuring. The views are stunning, the visit was at night so you get to see the lights of the city. Once we had enjoyed the views from the open air viewing platform on the 86th floor, we went in the lift to the top deck which is an additional cost but worth it as it is enclosed and a different views from the 102nd floor. Fab visit, busy but worth it.",5.0,4.8892
4020,Great Views,Went at night and the views were stunning. We thought the price of £100 to get to the 102nd floor was very expensive.,4.0,3.7636
4021,Easily accessible!,I visited with 2 wheelchair bound friends and couldn’t be more complimentary of the staff at the Empire State Building. Everyone was so helpful and they truly took care of us. Thanks to everyone who helped us!,5.0,4.9192
4022,Empire State is King (Kong) of the Observatory Tours,"Visiting one of 'The Big - or should that be Tall - Three' was at the top of the list for my daughter this summer. We were mainly doing NYC on a budget, so it was only ever going to be just the one - from the One World, Rockerfeller or Empire State, so which one? Taking various factors into the consideration, we settled on ESB. For us, the draw of the King Kong link was a factor as was the slightly more relaxed attitudes to booking times. As we were commuting daily from Staten Island, we wanted to rock up and take our chances, rather than have some ultra-specific time slot and also, our holiday home location meant that we were always long gone by the evening, so wanted to see the Big Apple at Sunset, or thereabouts. We wandered in off the street in the height of the summer, queued for approximately five minutes and went for the option of a meal included (at nearby Tacombi). I had wild fantasies of dining in the clouds, but no, Tacombi is firmly on the ground floor. What makes ESB an iconic trip is the superb displays relating to King Kong, an electronic mural of film clips featuring New York's favourite giant gorilla and a great photo op. We never felt rushed and the disappointment of realising Tacombi wasn't situated in the clouds vanished when being able to walk through one of the ESB's gorgeous corridors on the way to our delicious meal (including a beautiful Pina Colada for me) that was excellent value. One of the highlights of our visit - the most expensive, but worth it!",5.0,4.981
4023,Great value.,"Top attraction. Arrived 9am straight up, no need for fast track upgrade. Paid extra for the floor 102 and worth it. 86th floor got busy quickly. Clouds rolled in low after a while which obscured view but was not a problem. Perhaps consider weather forecast? Staff fantastic and informative.",5.0,4.7462
4024,Excellent,"The best of all the tall buildings in NY. Great interactive experience and the best view. Better than One World Observatory as that's just an 'up, view and back down' bit this was more inclusive.",5.0,4.8936
4025,Great view,"Got there just as the sun was setting and the view was stunning. My only complaint are the lines to get to the 80 and 86th floor. If you want the best photos wait until you are on the 86th floor, so you won't have any glare from windows.",5.0,4.4192
4026,Loved it! A must do.,Visited for the first time this past weekend and everyone loved the observatory and views. The Fast Pass was definitely the blessing and way to go!,5.0,4.7554
4027,Appalling from start to finish and extremely rude and unhelpful staff,"There was no queue system in place. Paid extra for fast track but did not get the service, no signage to indicate where to line up, extremely rude and unhelpful staff. Over priced.",1.0,1.3332
4028,Surprisingly enjoyable,"I went to the Empire State as my wife really wanted to visit, but was expecting it to be a horrendous tourist trap. I was pleased to be proven wrong. The exhibits are interesting, the queues efficient and the view naturally beautiful. Definitely a must see in NY.",5.0,4.6541999999999994

4030,Wonderful Experience,Very informative and enjoyable! Beautiful views!! The employees were helpful and kind. The gift shop was my favorite one in the NYC area.,5.0,4.928
4031,Sooo busy express pass way to go!,My daughter and I went during the busy Christmas season. Line to get in was the full length of the building! But with the express pass we went right to the door showed our pass and walk in. The series of lines in the building were also not an issue as we were shuttled to a quick line waiting only a few minutes to get on the elevator. The same treatment to go down the elevator. The experience was stress free and we had terrific views of the city! I also loved that the pass can be used any time during the day so you have flexibility with your visit.,5.0,4.8924
4032,Empire State,Exceeded expectations. Very little wait time to get through security and on elevators. Staff friendly and helpful.,5.0,4.6251999999999995

4035,Great but freezing,Amazing views no surprises there but would recommend going early in the day and on a sunny day (if in winter) to avoid the crowds and ensure you can see. Was freezing at the top so bring gloves and scarves! Also still crowded and queues at 11am in December.,4.0,4.7864
4036,WOW!!!!!,"So beautiful and well cared for. Great staff , you can tell that they love working there , they were so fun and helpful. The history tour was amazing . I'll be back !",5.0,4.9670000000000005
4037,Nice e but crowded,"It was very nice. Maybe a little more organized with where to go (enter, exit). It was also very crowded but considering the holiday season it’s understandable.",4.0,4.361
4038,It was amazing!,"Although excited, I was a little nervous to take the elevator ride. I didn’t share this with anyone, but your staff was very professional and courteous. Little did they know, that helped me tremendously. I loved the historical exhibit and the modernist interior. Thanks for helping my family and I have an memorable experience. Night crew/staff, keep up the good work!",5.0,4.9518
4039,Anniversary Tour,"Booked an AM & PM tour for our wedding anniversary and had a blast. Managed to get there by 0930 in the morning on a Saturday and the ques were still small. There is so much to see and do, and to make it better the staff are really helpful which makes the experience even better. The views are amazing from the 86th floor during the day and at night. We went back at 2300 in the evening for the PM tour, and there were only a few people on the 86th floor at this point. Great experience and one not to be missed, we had a great time and a wonderful anniversary. Thank you.",5.0,4.9634
4040,Princess,"Felt like princesses with the express pass. Worth every penny, skipped right past the huge, 1 hour + line. Treated so nice by every single person. Loved it.",5.0,4.8438
4041,Get there early!,"Got to the ESB around 9:30am and was able to walk straight to the security area - no wait! By the time we got back outside after our visit (about 10:45am), the line was outside and down the block. Go early and buy tickets online ahead of time to avoid the long lines and crowds!",5.0,1.89
4042,Family trip for the holidays,Lines took way too long. Need more staff to assist and keep the flow of visitors moving. At several points the amount of people just not in the right lines were very frustrating. When it is the holidays and you know that your amount of visitors will be high you need to plan for that. A 4 1/2 visit was way too long.,4.0,2.6974
4043,"Passive Aggressive Customer Service, Crowded and Unsafe Conditions","Every customer service and security person we met was disgruntled and passive aggressive. The viewing areas were overcrowded and chaotic. There was an hour long wait from the 80th to the 86th floor. They let everyone walk up 6 flights of stairs instead, but the stairs were too crowded to be safe. I can't imagine what would have happened if there had been a fire or other emergency. I will never be back. There are other observation decks in town that are not as crowded or has as long of a wait.",1.0,2.1006
4044,Great experience!,"Took my 12 to son. While it was exceptionally crowded (early December in NYC always is) once through security it did not seem that bad. About a 15 minute wait.

4054,Not to be missed . . . .,"We arrived at about 10:00 A.M. to a short line, taking about 20 minutes to get to ticket machines. You are led through a series of waiting areas but lines moved quickly. There are displays to help you past the time. The King Kong exhibit was great, with many photo opportunities. You are whisked to the 80th floor for additional exhibits. You then take another elevator to 86th floor and the outside observatory. There is then another elevator to the recently reopened 102nd floor. A trip to NYC would not be complete without a visit here.",5.0,4.8548

4059,What a view and great facts about the structure,"Entering the building and headed towards the elevators was a nice walk. The videos and all the facts were presented just perfectly. At times you could realize what the builders were doing and feeling in the 1930s as they erected the massive building. Nicely done! The views were perfect 360 degree sites of NYC, the waters and NJ. Just breath-taking!",5.0,4.8802

4065,Iconic Building with Amazing Views,"This is my 4th visit to NY, and my 2nd visit to the ESB. It was great to see the exhibits/experiences had changed since my last visit and found them extremely well thought out and imaginative of the decades gone by.
The new King Kong experience was fantastic, although it might be a good idea to introduce a queuing system for photo opportunities, as people were constantly jumping ahead of us.
Staff were very friendly throughout the building and that must deserve some credit considering the amount of people that pass through daily!
The views take your breath away (nothing to do with how chilly it is)!",5.0,4.9386

4067,Invest in the express pass,"If you’re going to visit the Empire State Building one time in your life, invest in the express pass. It’s a difference in cost of $35 each. My sisters and I bought value passes. It was so frustrating, because we stood in an unorganized make shift line shuffling forward a few steps at a time towards the elevators (on four occasions during the tour) while the express pass holders breezed right by. A 30 minute tour took us 2 hours. This photo cost me $38 and lots of aggravation.",3.0,2.3456

However, it took forever (it felt) to get through security and even though we had pre booked tickets and been told this would enable us to skip the queue, this wasn’t true...we were in the line for ages. The ESB has inevitably become a commercial venture, but I would still recommend a visit.",4.0,4.5686
4073,Well worth it,Had a New York explorer pass and decided to go late at nite to see the city lit up (previous days were snowing so didnt go as visability would be pour) ended up going at 12.30am and was a great time to go (it's open to 2am) there was only a few other people there...we walked straight in ..no line and went straight up . Breathtaking views amazing to see the city at night. Paid the extra $20 to go to the newly opened 102 floor it is all glass ... dont know if its necessarily worth paying the extra money as no real difference in the view ur just a bit higher up. The staff were amazing all very friendly and helpful even at that time of night.,5.0,4.9486

It’s beautiful and the updated experience is fab.
You cannot escape the magic of walking out onto the observation deck and seeing the beautiful city of New York.
We had a New York Pass so it was free entry. We went for opening time so there was no queue. Spectacular views. You cannot come to NYC and not do this!! I’d also recommend going up at night too to really appreciate the views.",5.0,4.899
4075,Hop Off Bus Tour,"We chose a cold dry day to take an open top tour and made our way to the Empire State Building. It’s my 4th trip, my wife’s first but the magic is always there. You can smell New York when you look down onto the yellow cabs rushing up and down the avenues and across the streets, smells of coffee, bagels, pretzel, hot dogs, and money, it’s all down there, spot Macy’s, the Chrysler Building. The Hudson and East Rivers. Brooklyn and Central Park.

Get your photos from the automatic face recognition system, it’s amazing.",5.0,4.53
4076,Nighttime Viewing Recommended,"The views of the city at night were magnificent. Staff were courteous, efficient and very helpful. I would highly recommend the building. Holiday decorations were elegant",5.0,4.9338
4077,Wow,On a 2nd visit to this iconic landmark and was not disappointed. Updates from the lift ascent to the interactive and informative visuals were a surprise and entertaining. Successful updates since my 1st visit 4yrs ago. Brilliant nightime experience.,5.0,4.8754
4078,Amazing,All staff were super friendly and extremely helpful. Not too long of a wait either and when with on the 80th or 86th floor the views are amazing all round. Would highly recommend,5.0,4.9
4079,Excellent experience,"The most breathtaking experience, not only the views but the museum was of the highest quality. Not to be missed.",5.0,4.078
4080,Rain check,"we booked the ticket ahead of time, for Monday. Even though it was horrible weather, we thought we had to go, because the ticket was dated. Turns out, one of the securities recommended, we come back on Tuesday, since the tickets are valid for one year! Perfect recommendation, because the weather was PERFECT",5.0,4.6739999999999995
4081,Great Views,"Went at night and fantastic views all across the city, pity that there aren't clear glass panels like at the top of the rock for photos, there is metal railings instead but great views all the same.",5.0,4.6726
4082,Amazing view from iconic landmark,"This was to be one of the highlights of our five day visit to New York and whilst it was a clear day weatherwise and we saw a lot of landmarks from the top - I was slightly disappointed that we were not given clear directions as to where to enter our skip the line . There was no guide available to ask about what to expect .
Perhaps issue a flyer guide for skip the line customers to explain how to “skip the line” advise on security check , photo opportunity , how long to spend in the museum , information area .
I had to keep finding a guide to ask what to do next and if we could skip the line on the way down too. They were very helpful btw but I feel that there should have been more signage to guide the skip the line customers as after all we were paying for this experience.
Nevertheless a unique experience and not to be missed.",4.0,4.5122
4083,Best NY attraction for good weather,"After 2 days of rain and snow the sun decided to show up in Manhatten mid December, so I thought there should be a good view from the top of the Empire State Building and was I right...
Beautifull 360 view of the city and all the area around it - breath taking!",5.0,4.2228
4084,Yes - it really is that good !,"This was the big one on our trip to NY, the no.1 place that we all wanted to go.
We went at the start of the day, around 10 am and found that there were not the huge lines that we had expected.
There is a kind of museum feel to the street level with lots of interesting stuff about what used to be on the site, how the place was built, when and by who, also lots of refences to its appearance in films.
King Kong is heavily featured here and you will see him once you have gone up to the first level, cleverly featured on the outside of the windows.
The highest level observation windows give fantastic views of the city, OK it's not the tallest anymore but it's still in the top handful and is so stylish and iconic, it's just better than any other skyscraper in NY in my opinion.",5.0,4.793
4085,Amazing at night,"Went up around 10pm, blown away with the view and whole experience. Great tip for anyone visiting. Do Empire State late at night and Top of the Rock in the day. The Rock gives you a better view of Central Park.",5.0,4.6632
4086,"Stunning, just as expected","We booked our visit directly on the empire state web. It wasn't more expensive and it certainly gave us the security we're not being lied to. We chose the day acording to the weather forecast and it couldn't have been better, not a single cloud in the sky. We started our visit around 11am. There were people, but it was not crowded so far. Up on the 80th floor you may found some queue for the elevators to the 86th, but you can always choose the stairs. There's Empires' crew everywhere always ready to help if you need it.
It was certainly one of the best experiences in NYC.",5.0,4.9166
4087,"Good enough for King Kong, good enough for me",Been to New York many times but a lousy tourist and usually stumble over things rather than plan trips out. However with my wife this time and she had it all mapped out including ESB. Well glad I did it - for both the views and the delightful attendant who announced to everyone that we came from Tasmania and then insisted that she take our photo. She was an absolute gem and I still smile when I think about how she just took over. What a character. Worth every cent.,5.0,4.8271999999999995
4088,Still an icon of skyscrapers,"First visited the Empire State Building in the 90’s. It’s popularity has faded somewhat as the Rockefeller centre’s Top Of The Rock has taken over but I love it. Unfortunately on this visit the visibility was poor but the internal parts were quirky and funny. Well worth a visit and, apart from the view, I much prefer it to the Top of The Rock",4.0,4.8022
4089,Great experience!!,"The empire state building takes observation tower to a whole other level.

They provide you with a full walkthrough exhibit of the history and building of the tower.

Exhibits were very informative and looked great. They also have several great locations for pictures.

The lines were short and the staff were great!",5.0,4.8546
4090,Two Visits in One Day,"We bought the ticket package that gave us 2 visits in one day ... one during the day, and then a return at night for the spectacular lighted views. Probably don't need to do all the observation decks, unless you have a real obsession (Top of the Rock, One World & Empire State), but in our opinion this is the iconic one, and the elevator videos, 2nd floor museum and King Kong peaking in the windows make it fun and enjoyable.",5.0,4.645
4091,Renewed!,I had the opportunity of visiting the renewed lobby. And the views of NYC from the observation deck are spectacular as always.,5.0,3.8808
4092,Very well designed,"A very enjoyable experience. The layout was excellent and the staff very friendly and helpful. Paid extra for priority tickets, which we didn’t really need which was annoying as it was quite quiet (went around 10am)",5.0,4.789
4093,Twice as nice,Had to be done on our first trip to the USA and despite being a little mist we had a great time. Enjoyed the exhibition on the way up and the Iconic views over NYC from the top. We had a AM / PM ticket so got to see the view by day and the lights at night well worth a few extra dollars.,4.0,4.8084
4094,The best!,Went before 8am so no queues - amazing sights one of the best things I did in NYC as a first time visitor and highly recommend,5.0,4.6956
4095,Crowded,Wish I had gotten the express pass. I can check it off my bucket list. It is something I’ve always wanted to do. Expensive for elevator rides and long lines. We were there around 11:00 am,3.0,3.8038
4096,Evening Visit,"Visited here on 9 September 2019. Went in the evening. Hadn't pre booked, but no queue when we arrived. Highly enjoyable.",5.0,3.718
4097,Empire State,"Wow! This is such a great learning experience. I thought I was just going to the top of a tall building and looking down at the city, but it was so much more! I was amazed.",5.0,4.7844
4098,Can’t miss!,This is truly a cant miss stop in New York City. My daughter wanted to see where Buddy the Elf’s dad worked but she got so much more out of it,5.0,3.7702
4099,Awesome,"Having been up the Rock in the daytime, we decided to visit the Empire State Building late in the evening to see NYC at night. What a beautiful, breathtaking view.",5.0,4.569

4101,Love the NYC view!!,"The visit was wonderful, great view, managment and security was the best.

The building history was very well explained by different ways.",5.0,4.9002
4102,Fantastic experience,"My wife and I visited in December and purchased tickets in advance. We added the 102 floor observatory to this. The views were fantastic even though it was a cloudy day. It is well worth doing the higher floor just for the experience.
The elevator ride up was great as the panels show the building being built around you.
The staff were all helpful and curious, willing to help or answer any questions.",5.0,4.9104
4103,Amazing!!!,"Great staff, great building and spectacular views (we visited at night). Much better than Top of the Rock.",5.0,4.8338
4104,Not Sleepless in Seattle,"This attraction deserves its place as a highlight of any visit to the Big Apple. From the moment you step inside you are aware this is going to be something quite special. Late in the day probably saves a bit iof queueing and enables some fine photos t be taken of the sun setting over the city.
Enjoy the ground floor exhibitions and don't forget to smile when your photo is taken. You'll pay for it later. Even the ride up in the lift has a little unexpected extra. Take the chance to walk down the 6 floors from level 102 to the Observatory. Even the Gift Shop is good.",5.0,4.9084
4105,"Love,Love,Love it","Thoroughly enjoyed it as there is a lot to look at on the way up , this is the one high building we enjoyed the best , definitely our favourite.",5.0,4.867
4106,"Iconic building, newly renovated spaces/ museum","No other building is as famous and recognizable as ESB. Went up for sunset viewing on Thanksgiving day. Some lines were long but, they gave an option for 80th-86th stairs ( instead of waiting 30 plus min for elevator ride). Chose not to go to 102nd floor viewing area due to time constraint. The views were amazing even on 86th floor. It was windy and cold but the outer viewing areas had heaters. Also had inside option for viewing as well.",5.0,4.6094
4107,Best NY view,"This is the best view you can have of NY city (at day and night).
We bought the ticket with city pass so
No need to wait for any queue.

4109,Fabulous building wonderful visit!,This is a marvellous building & justly world famous. The staff were helpful & polite & I must say you have the best gift shop with quality gifts & lovely staff! The escalator is amazing as is the view (of course) & the wind was freezing but well worth it!,5.0,4.8556
4110,The view was amazing,The visit is amazing if you have never been to the Empire State Building. My only hiccup would be getting in. I understand the security checks.... but then to the ticket booth.... you would think there would be a separate line for people that already had their tickets in hand but no there wasn't. That is my complaint. Defeats the purpose of having tickets ahead of time if there isn't a quick check in for those.,4.0,2.9226

4115,Empire State,"Absolutely fantastic, the history, the views unbelievable. Really helpful, friendly staff would recommend a visit to this attraction to anyone who is coming to new york",5.0,4.9072
4116,Night View,"Once you'd got past the airport styled security and the building work covering the outside hiding the name of the place it's a good attraction. To me it had more queues than top of the rock, opposite to what I was expecting. I liked looking out from the top floor at night but found looking at this impressive building better from the Rockefeller area.I liked the part of seeing the celebrities who'd been up empire state and the gift shop (reasonable price). Worth a visit on the New York Pass.",4.0,4.9556000000000004

4179,A lot of waiting,"I spent about 2 hours waiting and walking in herd lines, where there’s no real “line” so everyone feels entitled to push past you and get in front of you (I was pushing a stroller, so they didn’t have a personal space restriction). The guy next to us in line was also pushing a stroller, and he was separated from his family by more than 30 feet by people cutting in front of him. I think they tried to improve the waiting by giving you fun things to look at, but mostly it was just distracting, and all of the constantly flashing lights and loud noises just made it impossible to have a conversation and gave me a slight headache. I would have preferred a defined line through a rope course over this. After all the waiting and standing, we finally made it to the elevators and had to go stand in line again to go up a second set of elevators to get to the right floor. Then we spend 30 min up on the observation deck, because you can only look at the tops of building for so long. Then another line to get down the elevators again. Perhaps there isn’t a better way to do all of this, but I don’t think it was worth $45 each and so much of my time.",3.0,4.8194

4197,Night Sky,"I’ve been to the Empire State Building many times but this was my first time to visit after dark. I’d recommend it over daylight viewing for two reasons. Firstly the were no queues at all compared to early in the day when you can be queueing for an hour or more. Secondly viewing the city at night was spectacular. It was easier to spot iconic buildings from the 86th floor. It’ll do wrap up well, it’s pretty cold up there after sunset.",5.0,4.8044

When you get to the top it’s just magical definitely a view I will never forget. Everything is well organised throughout and there is lots of staff on hand to keep you on track.

The only downside was the staff members who take the photos at the start and then the staff members when you go to pick up your photo on the way out not only are they rude they are also quite aggressive I witnessed one lady tell a family that they had no picture as it was to weak but the manner in which she explained this was awful the children were really upset.

All in all a great experience just let down with some rude team members.",3.0,2.5394

4209,Cloudy Day was PERFECT!,"We had made online reservations ahead of time to go to the top of the ESP -- 102nd floor and all; so when we saw that the forecast called for clouds and rain, we were pretty bummed. It ended up being a blessing, though, because it meant NO LINES! We arrived at about 9:00AM, and the coast was clear! We quickly and easily walked through the entrance, perused the museum, and took the elevators up to the 80th floor to look around...then up to the 86th to look around and go outside...and then used out special passes to access the highlight of the visit -- the 102nd floor observation deck with floor -to-ceiling windows. The employees were all very cordial and the visit was very well organized. The view was spectacular-- even despite the clouds and the fact that it started to rain. So I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND going to the ESB, especially the 102nd floor, and encourage you to not let a cloudy day stop you! It might turn out to be better than expected! Our 9-year old son was AMAZED and LOVED it!",5.0,4.9764

If you do the same, plan on being stuck in long lines with no bathrooms. Apparently there is a bathroom on the 2nd floor, but I did not see any signs for it. There was a restroom by the gift shop when exiting. That was the only one I saw.

It was honestly too crowded to be enjoyable. The observation deck was just super packed. you could hardly move around. For me, that's just not enjoyable. Sorta had that tourist trap feel to it.

For comparison, a couple days later we went to the One World Observatory, and it was much less crowded with more bathrooms, etc.. This was in the afternoon and there was no waiting to go to the top at all.

So, to summarize: Get there when they open and be sure to use the restroom on the 2nd floor in case you get stuck in long lines after that.",3.0,4.9033999999999995

4235,4 PM time a bit crowded,"We purchased tickets to 102nd floor through website. I must have missed some fine print when receiving email confirmation. The visit was most confusing. First we discovered that confirmation print out was not sufficient. Wandered through the crowds to get a “real” ticket. Then through the lines and crowds to see the very well done museum. It was towards the end of a long NYC touring day with an 8 year old autistic child, so we hoped to skip part of the tour and head for a quick look from 102nd floor. Not possible. First you wait in line to get to 82nd floor. Then a choice of walking up or another line to get to 86th floor to get elevator to 102nd floor. It was a bit easier to get down, through the gift shop and back on the street. The 8 year old took the whole herding experience better than the 76 year old in our party. Was it worth it? Definitely Yes! Just be forewarned and prepared. Perhaps earlier in the day would be better when the crowds may be less and everyone in the party not near exhaustion.",4.0,4.9604

Die Visite hat sich gelohnt, da man von hier aus sehr gut alle Bereiche New Yorks überschauen kann und sich in den vergangenen Jahren, besonders in der südlichen Richtung, baulich viel verändert hat. Mein Ausflug folgte auf einen Regentag mit schlechter Sicht. Deshalb überlegte ich den Kauf eines Express- Passes, um zu erwartende Besucherschlangen zu umgehen. Ich habe es glücklicherweise nicht getan. Meines Erachtens nach lohnt sich die Zahlung des nahezu doppelten Preises nicht, da sich nach meinen Beobachtungen alle Besucher, egal ob Eintrittskarte, Express- Pass oder gar nichts, zunächst auf der Straße an die lange Schlange anreihen mussten. Erst im Gebäude hat man dann einen Zeitvorteil, den man allerdings bei dieser Preisdifferenz verschmerzen kann.",4.0,1.0554

A couple of surprises, a good attraction overal",5.0,4.9448
4279,wonderful experience but some employees were really disrespectful,"i choose the most expensive priority access ticket and at some point, at the 86th floor i asked a lady where i was supossed to go to access the 102th floor , she just ignored me, she was explaining everyone where they need to go for the 86th floor. I try again to ask her, but she just answered I WONT ANSWER YOU MAM... she was talking to her collegue and didnt care about visitors. When you pay 200 dollars the minimum you can wait is to have respect...
the view was extraordinary but this kind of behaviour makes you feel like a stupid tourist.... so sad....",1.0,1.414
4280,"Great views, not such a great price and hoards of people.","Despite having a long queue this moved quickly and before we knew it we were up the stairs and standing at a ticketing machine that told us cheapest option was over $40 USD Each. To include both lower and upper deck cost was over $60 USD each
Very expensive when you consider the Eiffel Tower in Paris to the second floor costs €11
Very expensive and other places in NY to get a fab view that are not so dear.",4.0,2.523
4281,amazing view especially in the evening,"Out of expectation ！ very worthy to have a check ！ I am Asian from big city and big buildings are not surprising thing for me .

4287,Great attraction with reasonable service,"newly refurbished visitor centre works well, spacious and no rush thru it. Finding entrance is bit iffy (needed check 3 entrances before we found right one) but with better signs will improve. If you come early you will miss queues.",4.0,4.55
4288,One off the bucket list - great views,"I missed getting here the last time I was in NYC so this time I wanted to go, so went by myself and got in so easily. No lines, no queues for lifts very easy. Coming down was a different story, it took quite a while to get out, queuing for the lift.
There are 2 stages to this experience, the first takes you to a floor with no external aspect but it's primarily an empty room with some photos on the wall, so seemed to be an overflow area for when it's busy, like a holding area for the main viewing deck.
once out of the 2nd lift, the amount of people suddenly hit, so I'd hate to be here on a super busy day, and have to wait to get up.
Of course once you are there the views outside are spectacular and well worth it. It would be great to see the views at night as well as during the day, although I only did the day one, so perhaps next time I might go back for the night viewing.
With the development happening in NYC and new skyscrapers going up I feel the view has diminished over the years, it was difficult to see Central Park, but don't get me wrong it is still amazing. You can still see the Statue of Liberty for example.
The photo opportunity is nice, if you want to do it and pay extra, I did as I had no one to take a photo of me, and a selfie just isn't the same.
I also felt it was reasonably priced, so I'd recommend going, if you're ok with heights. I was a little shaky.",4.0,4.976

4292,Beautiful view at a price.,"Great experience, helpful very friendly staff. Very nice exposition off the history off the building. The price for admission was a bit steep. Hopefully this can come down a bit. But once you get all the way to the top of the building you get stunning views of the city that never sleeps. In the end it still remains a must have visit when you go to New York. Amazing!",4.0,4.9244

4294,Experience???,"The views were beautiful experience was terrible... Most of my time was spent waiting in line waiting for an elevator.

4298,Great view but disorganized and annoying experience.,"We bought the fast pass tickets: $35 extra ($93) to bypass the lines all the way up, including the museum, 86th floor observation deck and the new 102nd floor deck. You should have hired a traffic consultant. From start to finish, we were commingled with the $58 ticket holders at least 4 times and had to produce our tickets for scanning 5 times to get back on the express route. And the scanners didn’t work well, so that was a big pain in the neck. After visiting the 86th floor deck we were told the $58 ticket holders and the $93 ticket holders would have to wait in line together to get an elevator to the 102nd floor. That took at least 15 minutes, which more than negated the approximate 10 minutes total we may have saved from the time we entered the building to the time we left. Not worth $35. I felt ripped off. Don’t get me wrong, we had a great time (6 of us including 3 international visitors on their first trip to the USA). The view is awesome from both 86 and 102. But the Express Pass is a total and complete rip off.",4.0,3.5996

4307,Late,"I booked the sunrise experiance, it was 250 bucks for my girlfriend and I.

4310,Good views...after LONG waits!,"The views are great, but it’s pure pandemonium getting up three elevators to the 102nd story. Don’t get those tickets as it’s a pure waste of time. The views are good enough from the 86th floor. There is no system to get people up and down. Everyone is running around aimlessly trying to figure out which line to queue up in with some lines going up and other lines going down. The workers are absolutely clueless and everyone gives a different answer. I feel badly for the foreign tourists who looked absolutely baffled. It’s really a disorganized mess.",2.0,1.1164

4331,if your short of cash spend it on something else not value for money,don't go when its going dark as you wont get clear pictures as the light bounces back off the windows and the outside of the windows are blurred and dirty. long ques when you think it wont be long like 20 mins actually turns out to be more like an hour. not worth the money something you will do once and never again its kind of better looking at it rather than from it,3.0,1.5042

Also we were pleasantly surprised about the museum/exhibition about the building. It brings home the making of history. Also we liked the interactive elevator, that has been not there last year. Nice touch. But even better are now the infrared heaters installed at the building to keep you warm whilst you enjoy amazing views.
Tip: come before sunset, so you can enjoy the city views three ways: Day/Dawn/night.

We enjoy that there is no time limit, so bring a warm coat, a head, scarfs, gloves and you reading for an amazing show up there. Take your time!",5.0,4.9904

4336,Iconic. Must See.,"Visited late afternoon, moved swiftly through security and on to exhibition. Am not going to give too much away but this is one of the best visitor attractions I have seen. With this building it is not just about the height. It is about it's history and construction which was for it's day a wonder of the modern world. And that was before we got to the amazing views. They are truly amazing. Plenty of staff on hand, and all were friendly and helpful. They kept the ascent and descent to a minimum of waiting, very efficient.A good value, must see attraction.",5.0,4.9898
4337,One of the best and most important things to visit in NYC,The Empire State Building is iconic and one of the best things to do in New York City.

4338,Solo Trip to the Empire State Building,"I went to the Empire state Building on a solo trip and had a fantastic time! I traveled to both observation decks and both were breathtaking. I will say that the top level was well worth the money with floor to celling windows. The attendant was very kind, chatty, and volunteered to take my picture. (I will say that on the level below the attendants were not as nice. I asked one to take my picture (as I was alone) and he stated ""I think you could ask someone else to take a photograph"". This is the only reason I am not giving 5 stars. I believe a few more attendants, like the lady on the top level, should be throughout. This is a big attraction and not everyone has someone to visit along with them. It really made me quite sad when he stated that and I was too shy to ask anyone else. Luckily, a lady overheard this and stopped to take my picture.

I went at 8:30 on a Monday morning and had bought my ticket ahead of time. Because of these two things I went through the line in less than 10 minute. I highly recommend this if you wish to avoid the crowds.",4.0,4.9154

4341,Best view of NYC at night,"Choose a late time to visit and it won't be crowded. As it is not so close to Times Square, it is easier to take a taxi / Uber to and from there.

The renovations are super nice and definitely help justify an overpriced ticket. Kids 12 and younger will enjoy it, but after 5 minutes at the top they were done. It’s iconic. It’s a bucket list item. Probably won’t do it twice.",5.0,4.8233999999999995

There are all lawyers queues, but the only time they move slowly is the security bit (airport style). The place is well designed to keep the flow of people moving. You can go to 80th floor then the 86th - if you want the very top you need to upgrade (we didn’t bother).

They have green screen photos taken of each group on the way up that you can buy on the way down that are actually really good quality and a super memento.

The views are incredible, and there are loads of interesting facts and exhibits on the way up.

4362,Seen it before? See it again!,"We visited the 86th and 102nd floors as well as the museum on Saturday, Nov. 9, 2019 - 7 years after our first time. No comparison. So much better now!

We took advantage of the Senior prices & purchased our tickets at the kiosk before entering the museum. Everyone had to stand in a long line for the elevator to the 86th floor after walking through the new museum. Look up for a grand video show overhead! Had we known that it’s one way up and then down and out, I would have lingered longer at the exhibits which were quite impressive.

Before entering the museum, we posed for a photo on green screen. We didn’t have to buy it; we didn’t like it. Husband and I stood in awe watching bits of all of the movies or TV shows on the video wall that included or featured the Empire State Building. I loved interacting with King Kong in one corner of the museum and stepping into elevators from the early days. The movie posters, memorabilia, and videos were amazing. I want to go back and spend more time in the museum.

The views are breathtaking on both levels. You are outside on the 86th floor. You are behind glass & in smaller quarters on the 102nd floor - accessible by another elevator, after standing in another line for an additional price (paid at kiosk). It was worth it.

The way down is by elevator or elevator and stairs. We opted for the latter as it was faster. The exit outside is after passing through the gift shop - inexpensive, moderate, & expensive items. We posed in front of the Christmas tree before leaving. We will return. Just not to the 102nd floor. Been there. Done that.",5.0,4.9654

4365,Terrific!,Beautiful renovations! Very informative and fun! We loved the observation deck. The Christmas decorations were also beautiful!,5.0,4.9054
4366,"Good view, terrible ticketing process and line management","TL;DR: Views from the 86th floor were good, but line management falls apart on 86, and a terrible ticketing system cost half our group the opportunity to check out the 102nd floor.

Went yesterday evening for the first time in years with family who were visiting from out of town. The ground floor / second floor experience was much improved over my last trip with plenty of light, room, and staff walking around. The museum was no Pirates of the Pancreas, but it had several informative displays and photo ops. The journey to the 80th floor and even up to the 86th floor was pretty quick and painless for an early Friday evening, but from there things fell apart.

After taking in the 86th floor outdoor views on a crisp clear night, we headed in to go up to the 102nd floor. There we found a large crowd of confused people semi-organized in a line in front of a single doorway with a sign above reading exit / 102. Every so often a polite older gentleman would pop his head out of the doorway to tell people they could walk down a staircase to the 80th floor instead of waiting for an elevator, but there was no one else around to direct people, and everyone was confused if the line was to go up or down.

It was also at that point I noticed the tickets I bought said 86th floor whereas the other part of our group had tickets that said 86th + 102nd floors. When I purchased my tickets on the 2nd floor I was only given two options - ""Regular"" or ""Express"". I knew the other part of the group didn't purchase express, so I chose regular. Thinking I might have missed something, I walked up to the kiosk on the 86th floor that said ""Upgrade your tickets here"", but when I clicked on the start button, the machine responded ""No products available"". When we finally got to the elevator to 102, sure enough, the elevator operator let half our group up, and half our group got denied. I was told I would need to go back down to the 2nd floor and purchase an upgrade to go to 102. Zero chance I was going to go through that hassle again, so half our group went downstairs disappointed.

When I got downstairs and spoke to a manager, I was told that sometimes the 102nd floor deck fills up, so they temporarily stop selling tickets. However, the ticket kiosks don't bother to tell you that the experience is sold out - instead they completely remove the option. So I had no way of knowing until I got all the way up to the 86th floor that half our group was going to be kicked back down to the ground while the other half got to go further up. And to add insult to injury, by the time we got downstairs the kiosks were selling access to the 102nd floor again. Absolutely terrible experience.",2.0,1.052

4371,"Amazing building, experience was lacklustre","I was excited to be visiting the Empire State, having viewed it from the Top of the Rock on our last visit. The museum is amazing, Lots of photo opportunities, before you reach the top, but depending on how busy it is, there's not many chances of getting photos without other people in them.

The majority of staff seemed like they wanted to be anywhere else but there, a real contrast to the rock. I found some to be really rude and unhelpful.

The view was amazing, better at the 102nd floor, where you have a bit more space. The outside observatory deck is great, but because it's so busy again, hard to get near the edge, or take photos without others being in them.

I would recommend going first thing in the morning, as when we came out around 11:30 there were queues out of the door.

All in all, it was great to visit the amazing building, but if I was you, I'd go to the Top of the Rock, the view is just as amazing.",3.0,4.9822

A few small queues - nothing to moan about.
And a great show in the elevator and some great history and photo opportunities along the way ensure you will appreciate the work that went into the building.
The view was unreal and so peaceful.
All staff were friendly and dressed smartly. You have to go through airport style security as in all the excursions in NYC but I think it is a good thing.

We were really lucky as there wasn't a Q and we took a gamble not getting priority.
For me the Empire State building is THE iconic building of NYC. Pardon the pun but it ""Trumps"" everything else!!
We watched the sunset over New Jersey and it was amazing, we were very lucky that the clouds cleared just as we went up(possibly the reason for no Qs)
We also did the One World Observatory which was good but no comparison looking through a window to feeling the wind at 80+ stories.

I did not enjoy the loud/hyped music with sound effects piped into the museum and within the elevators; not everyone who visits the building is an adolescent boy suffering from ADHD. Limiting the noise to a portion of the museum on second floor and keeping it out of the elevators would be perfect. The Empire State Building is iconic and, along with the Chrysler Building, I look forward to seeing them when I visit New York City.",4.0,3.9976000000000003
4396,A very well honed experience.,"We went just after dark and were not disappointed.

4401,Iconic,"So we decided not to go up the Empire State Building as we had already been to the One World Observatory and Top of the Rock which has a great view of this iconic building.

However we did go into the foyer and enjoyed the couple of photo opportunities there. What a difference compared to the foyer of the Crysler Building!

4407,Helpful tips,"The Empire State Building is an absolutely wonderful place to visit. I purchased my ticket ahead of time although the line to purchase a ticket wasn't very long at all. I visited on a Friday evening around 3:30 in early November. The sunset was around 4:45 so this gave me plenty of time to get through security (which is similar to going through security in the airport) and made my way through the lines up to the top. It took maybe ten minutes from the time I arrived at the Empire State Building, went through security, took the elevators and got up to the top. But I also didn't take a lot of time to look at all of the pictures, history timeline and Godzilla stuff, I just wanted to see the view! So if you are interested in seeing this other stuff, plan more time for yourself. Once at the top, there is a bathroom if you need one. There is a family bathroom as well. I arrive in time to see the view in daylight which was beautiful. Then came the sunset, which was amazing! Then I watched all of the lights as they came on across the city...amazing!!! I highly recommend doing it this way. It was very cold the day I was there. And since I was there from 3:30 to approx. 7pm, I would go inside on and off to warm up. Keep in mind that there is very little seating area at the top. In fact, there were only two benches and they were full most of the time. You are not allowed to sit on the floor, a security guard will come and tell you to get up. So unless you are prepared to stand for most of the time you are there, I wouldn't recommend this. When I really need to get off my feet, I waited by the bench for someone to get up and quickly took their seat! Overall, it is a great experience. Just remember if you have little ones and you plan to stay for a long time, there is not a lot of places to sit down. I saw a lot of unhappy little ones and exhausted parents!",5.0,4.9846

4439,Amazing memorable wedding party visit,"We took a group of 24 wedding guests up the Empire State as a wedding gift and to take photos. ( we got married at city hall in the morning ) We were very luckily it was a beautiful day and the sky was crystal clear.

Firstly - Lucy Heinla in sales was a great help. Being in America from the UK with no printer made it difficult to fill out the group form but we went to the Empire State two days before and she kindly came down and assisted with the forms. She’s been very helpful and knowledgeable in person and over email.

Secondly, at the top, Renita E. made our visit memorable. Please note we didn’t expect special treatment but her personal touch made our day. I came up the elevator on my own as my new husband got separated briefly and she made me wait for him - and he came out to a group of people giggling and smiling! She made us and our guests laugh and feel welcomed. She even took photos and gave our photographer some tips!

We love NYC and we wanted to bring our guests to the Empire State as we love the building and visited previously. It shows the best of the city and I don’t think anywhere else would have given us the amazing experience we had. All the staff we dealt with wished us well and were very knowledgeable. We had a group of six bridesmaids, four best men, old and young guests and a baby of four months with a pram - everyone enjoyed the visit.

THANK YOU RENITA - we will see you again on our next visit!

our tips - plan ahead as the queues can be long so enjoy the exhibits as you go up. the addition of these is really useful and keeps you entertained on a busy day. We did wait a while but for us we chatted to all of the guests and other tourists. be aware dry and clear days after bad weather will be really busy! If you’re a group purchase tickets in advance.

Like London’s Shard or The Sky Garden or Sacre Couer or the Eiffel Tower in Paris here is every traveller’s dilemma: do you want a an amazing view from a higher vantage point but without the landmark you’re viewing from, or do you want a decent view with the iconic landmark actually in it?

Well, the obvious answer is do both but if you don’t have that choice well, in all honesty, in New York at least, it doesn’t matter. We went up the Empire State mid week in mid November at around 4pm. It wasn’t busy. We didn’t even have to queue. And we had enough time to look through the exhibition. If this was skyscraper Top Trumps this is where the Empire State beats the competition hands down. It is just so iconic. The story, of a building built during the Great Depression at breakneck speed using working practices far ahead of its time, is just incredibly fascinating.

By the time we made our way through the exhibition and up to the top it was still daylight. The sun was just setting over the distant Atlantic. The city that never sleeps, looked like it was getting ready for an early evening nap. Lights started to appear illuminating a canvas splattered with brightly coloured paint.

It was just all incredibly moving, I was there with my other half, and if I’d been better prepared, I probably would’ve asked for her hand in marriage. It was just stunning, that moment, the sun set, the lights on and the sky darkening. Quite simply, one of the best views in the world.",5.0,4.9872
4450,Birthday gift,"An amazing experience... Wonderful! We wanna repeat again soon! The museum, 102-floor, and 86 floors were spectacular. King Kong was great. We are so excited",5.0,4.8574
4451,A must visit..shame about the weather,"On a recent family visit to New York this was always on the list of places for us visit. Included in the CityPass as an option we visited early morning. Unfortunately visiting on our last day which was foggy we persevered and went up.

There are multiple great exhibits regarding the construction of the building and the men who built it, as well as its success as a film location and symbol of New York. Even without the view at the top the exhibits are worthy on their own. Very impressive and particularly enjoyed the immersive experience of what it wouldve been like to work on the building. The lift up the top is also unique with a video to watch whilst in the lift.

It was eerie as it was so foggy and so couldnt see much, but could hear New York streets below. An iconic building and a must visit",5.0,4.7554
4452,Birthday visit,"Amazing building. The history and story regarding the building was brilliantly told.
Views were stunning and the staff were so friendly.",5.0,4.8768
4453,Beautiful views but choas to get out.,The views are stunning. Preference is as the sunsets. Only downfall is the ques to get down no system just choas you que for ages and when the ques get out of hand they then decide to suggest taking 7/8 flights of stairs down to the main lifts.,4.0,4.1148
4454,A sureal experiance,"I was visiting with my husband 3 children and their partners, the whole experience was one of the best memories ever made. One that will never be forgotten, and the sun setting made it very special.",5.0,4.6684

4457,"Empire State Building and ""State Bar and Grill""","We were totally misled by the website and thought we were purchasing a dinner at the State Bar and Grill along with tickets to for the Empire State Building. I'm NOT recommending to anyone to trust either the Empire State Building or the State Bar and Grill. BE CAREFUL - WE WERE SCREWED! However, the Empire State Building is a cool tour and is handled well by the floor staff.",3.0,4.3176000000000005
4458,Outstanding ESB VIP Tour with Gerard H,"We went on a Tuesday night in November and there was not much of a line nor was it that crowded at 9:00 p.m. If a shorter queue was the only reason for doing the Premium VIP Tour, then one could question the expense; however, when you add our incredible guide, Gerard H., the experience became priceless; that my wife and I were the only ones on the tour made it even better. Gerard is a fantastic guide. His encyclopedic knowledge of the history and construction of the ESB made for an incredible last night in New York. We have wanted to visit this New York City icon for years (after all, this was the skyscraper that the great Kong scaled!) and were very glad to have done the VIP tour and felt very fortunate to have Gerard as our personal guide.",5.0,4.9574

Beautiful city loved it
Everyone must climb this and see New York.
Would be nice at night time",5.0,4.8742
4461,Fabulous Views,Terrific overall experience. Amazing views. Great informative helpful staff. A must do when in New York.,5.0,4.86
4462,Pay our respects,Wanted to remember & pay our respects. We last visited over 10 years ago. Just take a minute to absorb the enormity.,5.0,3.4526
4463,Should have paid to skip the line,"We went on a Wednesday morning in October and spent 2 HOURS in line. Enjoyed the 20 minutes ay the top, but I thought my kids were going to kill me when we had to spend another half hour in line to get down!",4.0,1.5152
4464,Awesome,Breathtaking- I felt like I was reliving lots of the movies I’ve watched! Staff were helpful and welcoming. Well organised.,5.0,4.8233999999999995
4465,Worth it for the views,We got tickets in reception from a machine for both the 86 th floor and the 102nd. Cost was around 60 dollars each. Expensive but worth it for a once in a lifetime thing. Great views and not rushed at all.,4.0,4.604
4466,Emprie State Building,"I was in NYC and the Empire State Building was on my list of things to do. I ordered the tickets through Groupon, same price at the ETB website, but I wasn't charged a convenience fee. It was easy to go through, although it was crowded we were not able to view all the interactive displays on the 2nd floor. It would be nice if there was a bypass for people that didn't want to take their picture on a green screen, that was the longest wait. The elevator ride to the 1st stop was fast, they have a short video on the ceiling of the elevator that makes it seem like you are one of the workers building it. Even my teens thought it was cool.",4.0,4.8202
4467,Life time memory,It's a Life time memorable experience especially the 103rd floor. but felt little expensive 63$ ticket,5.0,3.0
4468,Beautiful Night,The Empire State Building is beautiful at night. We went on a chilly November night and did not have to deal with terrible crowds. My advice for anyone going on a chilly night is to bundle up. The heaters are on but they do not put out much heat. The night lights of the city are well worth the night visit. Bundle up and go experience the beautiful view!,5.0,4.802

4471,Amazing!,"An amazing building with a great history of the build on the way up and some fun features also including King Kong! Fantastic views - we were lucky to be there on a bright, sunny morning. We arrived early so no queues.",5.0,4.9342
4472,Amazing Views !!,"Like many we paid a visit here of which were very lucky as the queues were down to a minimum as Veterans Day parade was going on.
Again did not purchase the ticket in advance as queues were very little - we had to go via security before getting to the booth to pay. The option on the ticket prices were 43 dollars to the 86th floor or pay 63 dollars to the 102 floor ( to the top!!).I paid the full one.
You walk through the place which shows how this building was constructed which is amazing - today Health & safety would have kittens for sure !! In addition the coverage it has been used for film making, commercial advertising etc. You make your way up to the 86th floor ( yes via lifts) all staffed and controlled properly. Once you hit the 86th Floor the view we had on the day ( bright & sunny) were absolutely amazing you had full view of NYC- breathtaking. The usual selfies were taken and photos and then we made our way to the 102nd floor again - wow is the words I would use. Please note if you do not like heights or lifts then you don't go here.

On the way out you can collect your photo that has been taken before you start the tour as a momento if you want - we did cost was 36 dollars for 2 photos. Overall a brilliant experience.",5.0,4.9778

4476,So Amazing,"A number of people had told us not to go up the Empire State Building, as there were better views from Rockefeller. We are so glad we didn't listen!!! And although the views from Rockefeller have to be seen to be believed, the views from the Top of the Empire, are beyond words... what an experience... not just at the top, but on the way up too... great photo ops, especially with King Kong... totally unbelievable...",5.0,4.8326
4477,Fun,"The museum was fantastic and fun.
We learn a lot about the construction and how it was built. Not too much people. Low season
Thank you 🙏🏾",5.0,4.6148
4478,Wow iconic building.,"We had been kindly purchased VIP entry to visit as we had read the queues could be bad. On our visit we sailed through.
The whole experience was slick and not rushed. The information regarding its construction and the interactive exhibits were great. Especially the King Kong looking through the window. Great fun.
But the main attraction - the views stunning. We were fortunate to have a stunning clear day but boy was it cold. No rush to leave. This area was busy but not too much.
It's an impressive iconic building, a must see whilst in NYC.
Dont forget the amazing art deco entrance hall on leaving. On our visit there was a beautiful Christmas tree. The building is still a working one so there are parts you cant visit. But do visit the bar/diner round the corner. They still have many of he original fixtures from when first opened as a restaurant. Also great coffee.",5.0,4.9822

4485,Fantastic experience all round,"Staff were all really friendly and the views are absolutely spectacular. We were lucky to get there just for sunset and it was absolutely gorgeous. I was also very grateful for the heat lamps on the sides of the buildings - they definitely help you stay on the viewing platform for much longer than the November chill would otherwise allow! I had to hand in my padlock on the way up and realised hours later I forgot to pick it up - so we went back and everyone was lovely and it was an easy process to retrieve it. I would 100% do this again, we had a great time",5.0,4.9754000000000005
4486,Stunning views,We went here at night and paid the extra to go to the 102nd floor observatory. The views are magnificent and the staff were great. There is some great information as you head to the elevator. Very well done and worth a visit,5.0,4.8936

4491,Memorable Event,"Except very high cost of photo taken at the entry, everything was the best. The view of the city from 102nd Floor was really awesome.

The museum displays were very informative and interesting. Once you go up the views just keep getting better. The view from inside at the first stop are great. Then you go up to the outdoor observation deck which adds the wind. We paid to go up to the 102nd floor. Once to exit the elevator you see another spectacular view. The walls are all glass.

4542,Must See,If you are in New York you should definitely put the tour on your to do list. It was fun and interesting from start to finish!,5.0,4.6796
4543,"Stunning view, but also great museum","It felt like no trip to New York City would be complete without going up some tall building to see the NYC skyline. Admittedly there’s 3 choices to choose from and the key drawback to each is that you don’t see the building you’re in. My family and I went for Empire State Building, and did not regret it.

The views are inevitably the thing most will recall and think stands out, and the views are stunning. Seeing the full breadth and length of Manhattan from a 360 degree viewing area high above the rest is incredible. From 1WTC and the Statue of Liberty in the South to Rockefeller and Central Park to the north and all the extras in between, its incredible. The only surprise for me was both a real shortage of toilet facilities up on 86 (pee before you head up!) and a lack of awareness that stairs down were an option for many when going back to 79. Both would’ve saved me some time and annoyance.

The hidden gem part for me though was before you get up to the 79th floor. After the ticket purchase and security gate they have made a fantastic museum and showcase that details the history, building style, and pop-culture impact of the building in a lovely and entertaining series of exhibits, videos and displays. It was, to employ a pin visitors will get, thoroughly riveting.

Would warmly recommend, and if you time it right you can get day and night shots by going up around sunset.",5.0,4.9424
4544,"While the views were spectacular, of course, I was disappointed in the value of the 5 VIP tickets I purchased.","My husband and I are unable to climb the number of stairs required to get to the start. We took the elevator. When our ""tour"" was over, we inquired about seeing King Kong. We were advised that the exhibit is on the way in, but there was no indication of that ""on the way in"". We were told that we needed to exit the building, go around the block and reenter. Very, very disappointed.",3.0,1.1798

4546,Empire State Building Day and Night Admission Ticket,Firstly pre-book before you leave (you print your tickets online) The tickets are valid for any day at any time which is a really good idea.

4548,KHarris Birthday Trip to NYC,"Loved our visit to the Empire State Building. The museum was more than I expected, a definite plus, and the observation decks and views were spectacular. Enjoyed learning the history of the building as much as I did taking in the views. Highly recommend this to anyone visiting NYC!",5.0,4.8254
4549,Empire State,"Luckily, I went on Memorial Day - not too many people. Loved the history of it. View from top was amazing. Lady on 102 was delightful, and answered my questions about what building and bridge was what. Not cheap, but has to be done once!",4.0,4.6878
4550,The views are just WOW,"It's expensive, but we were lucky, it was a beautiful, clear day and the views from the lower balcony were just spectacular, didn't feel the need to go up to the higher floors, especially as the higher views are enclosed. Highly recommended",5.0,4.846
4551,Beautiful view at Night,Going up to the observation deck is just something you have to do when in Manhattan. I felt is was expensive but we had a clear night so the lights were gorgeous. We got there about 10pm and there was not any wait.,5.0,4.744
4552,Very Beautiful Experience,"We had a great visit here. The museum is very well done and informative. The reviews said to get the ""Skip the Line"" tickets which we did not. We took a chance, but it turned out when we went, there was very few people there. (it was pre-Thanksgiving in November). The place is set up to handle a lot of people (think Disney lines) with lots of ropes and ramps. We were lucky. If you go at a popular time, I would suggest you pay the extra money. The views at the top are just spectacular, I don't think you see much more at the 102nd floor, but we are glad we went up there for the extra $20. This is a must see if you visit New York City.",4.0,4.8842

4565,Great service and sight to see in NY,"I was staying at Row Hotel and jumped in an Uber to get to my meeting at the Empire State Building. Though it was a business trip, I definitely felt super excited to see inside for the first time. The attendants inside were extremely helpful and staff from the company I was meeting with were waiting for me downstairs. I didn’t have a lot of time to look around, but I got a picture to commemorate the moment. In case you are wondering, I did hum “Empire State of Mind” as I walked in. Next time I come back I’ll bring mini so she can take a look around. All attendants were well dressed and respectful.",4.0,4.827

4567,Amazing views,"It wasnt too busy when we went at 1300. The views were amazing. We had plenty of time to take photographs. If you are going to New York then this a definite place to visit. There was some dark clouds and sun shining, so some of the photos looked gloomy then with the sun shining too it made the photos look stunning. There was a golden roofed mosque, as the sun shone it made the roof gleam. I am so glad I had the opportunity to visit.",5.0,4.861
4568,Has to be done,"Another must do in NYC,doesn't need more explaining than this. The one drawback is that you obviously can't see a panoramic view of the building from within. To remedy, go to the top of the rock observation deck for photos.As previously mentioned, a must do.",4.0,3.4046
4569,Mr. Lugo,"The ride up to the the observation floor was handled quite well. The exit process could use some refinement. Some of the associates seemed frustrated and rude in the manner in which they addressed the tourists. Some were not understanding. Perhaps a supervisor should be on the grounds to rotate any associate from the area that may be flustered and needs to take a breather. One individual was loud and condescending and kept repeating ""walk down only"" without any explanation as to what he was referring to. There were some steps at his post that led to the elevator, but this obviously was not the correct line to the exit. Not exactly the correct approach to visitors.",4.0,2.081

Do not miss this iconic NYC landmark - a true piece of NYC and American history.,5.0,4.861
4576,A Must See on your NYC Visit,I was utterly impressed with the presentation at the Empire State Building. The presentation format makes you feel as you were then and there as the building was being built. The displays and sculptures are beautiful. You can take a pic within the hand of Kong. You can also sit on a bench alongside one of the building workers (a sculpture) and take pretty awesome pictures. The views are gorgeous. The guides along the way are fun and friendly.,5.0,4.9646

4583,Our visit to the Empire State Building,"There was NO line at all. Was great! Views were outstanding. Of course it was very breezy and cold outside, but you can have a great view without going outside too. There is a nice gift shop, but once you leave the gift shop after your tour, you cannot get back in. After our tour, we ate at Tacombi on the first floor. We made reservations and paid in advance, but it was not crowded at all. We paid for the Prix-Fixe menu which was $20 per person. It included an appetizer of your choice, two tacos of your choice, 3 non-alcoholic beverages (flavored Horchatas) or one with alcohol such as a margarita. The food was very tasty.",5.0,4.9374

4586,Dream come true,"I loved the architecture and even the lobby was worth visiting. The lift was a surprise and once my stomach had gotten over the surprise, interesting. The information upstairs was a surprise and very informative. I loved the interspersed statues of workers. Finally the views, it was worth coming up to see the view and its cliché but it was breath taking!!! A member of staff kindly told us what we were looking at and gave us some interesting information /history. Then we paid the extra and went up to the 102 floor, wouldn't have believed that it would have made that much difference but it did!!! Had to fight with my vertigo but luckily I won and very much the the whole experience.",5.0,4.9574
4587,Amazing 'Goosebumps' moment!!!,"WHAT THEHEEBEE SAYS THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING

I had that 'goosebumps' moment for few minutes as soon as I spotted the Empire State Building, standing majestically among other buildings and making everything else tiny, very tiny.

In my childhood I used to study - Which is the world's tallest building? and the answer was 'The Empire State Building'. The other modern marvels have taken over this record, but the Empire State Building holds that special feeling, that special place in history.

The Empire State Building is at a walking distance from Times Square subway station and every step that you take towards it increases the excitement. It looks magnificent and boasts of the sheer hard work that went into creating history. It is grand, it is tall, it has that charisma of an Empire!! One can just be there and spend minutes just looking at it and admire its existence. In the evenings, the look is further enhanced by the lights and the dark sky in the backdrop. Every time I think about this visit, I slip into gratitude to nature for making me see this iconic building in person.

I could not make up to the observatory as I had not planned properly and hence I was short of time. But I am sure I will someday visit again and take the tour up to the observatory on the 102nd floor and watch nature at its best!!

I’d precooked the tickets so unfortunately the day we visited it was slightly rainy, however this worked in our favour, as when we arrived around 8.30am, the place was empty! There were no queues and a plenty of staff around to chat to.
We paid to go to the 102nd floor which I would 100% recommend, as the view is amazing in every direction. When we got to the top we had the place to ourselves!!!! One of the lovely members of staff even took our phone and took pictures for us- a lovely touch! And really made the visit.

Ticket kiosks were easy to use. Option for express package noted, but as it wasn't peak season we didn't need it. We bought the package to go up to Floor 102.

Museum was great - elevator display was excellent. Would be fun for kids and adults alike.

There's elevators from the 79th floor to the 86th, but also the option to take the stairs - we took them, and it was a neat little exercise (literally) in seeing the inner workings of the building.

From 86 to 102 is elevator only - small area so you can only go about 8 people per elevator. It was hot! Not sure if the ventilation wasn't working but winter coats were off and we were sweating! It was cool to see the panoramic views. Not necessary in my opinion, but fun.

Elevator rides down were nice. Elevators have LED screens in the top of them to take you on the journey building the structure while you go up and down.

I was able to capture some of the moments after the sunset. It was beautiful

I like the overall observatory experience.

We went on 'off season' for tourists, and it still was wall to wall people and standing in lines for seemed like hours to get thru security to see the museum (which is there basically to keep you occupied while waiting to get on an elevator) and get to the top. A better choice to see the city is the Top of The Rock at Rockefeller Center. I'm not sure what the price was because it was included in our USA Guided Tours of NYC, but it was easy to get up and easy to get down and had a nice little museum and short movie included. If you are just there to see the city from high up, go to the Top of the Rock instead of the Empire State Building. There are beautiful views and not nearly so crowded.

4681,Brilliant view at night,"We chose to go at night and luckily we were not help up by any queues. As you would imagine the view is spectacular at night and makes for some brilliant photos.
The reason I have not scores it a five is because the deck around the outside where you look out is quite narrow and it felt like at times there were too many people up there so you waited for a view and found yourself constantly making sure you were not ruining people's photos.",4.0,4.771

I have an anxiety disorder so it was very scary, walking from Port Authority to the Empire State Building alone, and then back in the late evening. But my stay in the building was better than I expected. I was floored by the museum portion. The elevators were amazing as well. Whoever came up with that is a genius. The entire thing was well worth the ticket price. My only concern was that I couldn't tell which type of ticket I had. I didn't realize until later that I might have been able to bypass the long lines. I wish that had been more clear. I also wish the bathrooms were more clearly marked.

We were so impressed, too, with the wonderful “greeter” there. She welcomed each visitor, asked what country they’re from, and offered to help with photos. She provides such a positive impression of America and NYC. We believe the spelling of her name is Reneta.

Area for improvement: Provide a way to just go directly to the 102nd floor Observatory. You’re forced to go through stages and visit additional levels to finally get there.

Also, have Reneta “coach” other employees, for example Alfredo, an elevator coordinator on one level who doesn’t convey the same kind of positive image of NYC.",5.0,4.9648

The visit is very well managed. We arrived at about 10 and we didn't have to queue for a long time.",5.0,4.2722
4741,"Excellent staff, attraction and place",I have nothing but good memories at the empire state building. We did not encounter any problems in our visit. Maybe the time in line was something to point out but I think it was the expectable when going to this type of places. Not sure about the money because we used passes that let us enjoy the ESB for free.,5.0,4.591
4742,"no words, you have to be there and open your eyes as much as you can","I had been in the Empire years ago during the day and I though that it was better visiting it during the day but after being there at night, I have changed my mind and when I´ll be back I will go into during the day and also at night. Amazing! We had a perfect weather (that´s important for having a great views).
This visit is one of the MUST",5.0,4.9392
4743,Treated like VIPs,"I booked tickets for myself and two teenage daughters on my birthday to go up to the top and then to have dinner in the restaurant. I paid everything and received my confirmation but what I didn’t see in the small print was that the restaurant wasn’t open on Sundays (when we were planning to go). So when we turned up we were very disappointed to find that my special birthday dinner was not going to happen. To make matters worse, the weather was terrible. It was raining heavily and the low cloud cover meant that we couldn’t enjoy the wonderful view either.

The girl in the ticket booth called her supervisor, Ibrahim, to explain to me how I could get a refund and he couldn’t have been more helpful. Even though the weather was bad he took us up to the viewing deck and told us to come back the next day. When we arrived just before sunset the following day the queue to get in was extremely long, neither of my girls wanted to wait but we had made the journey over there for a second time so I didn’t want to walk away. I went to the front of the queue and was delighted to see Ibrahim there! He took me aside and said that he would escort us up to the top. So off we went, on the red carpet, fast tracked to the top thanks to this kind and very conscientious young man. We saw the sunset and the stunning views and all the disappointment from
my birthday the night before just disappeared. We couldn’t thank him enough for caring so much about our Empire State experience and it will always be remembered as one of our best New York highlights.",5.0,4.9624
4744,Get the fast access pass,We followed the red carpet and were whisked from elevator to elevator. It saved us 2 hours easily. The only way to go. We went at night and the views were sparkling spectacularly. Wrap up it can be windy and enjoy the magic of the Empire State Building at night.,5.0,4.725
4745,Super,Visited here around 11pm as part of an organized tour. We were only allocated 20 minutes to get up and back so it was rushed. A shame really as there was an exhibition as we entered on the construction etc which we couldn't stop to see. Really busy but the staff had the elevators well controlled. Amazing views but again so busy and so cold. Wear something warm. Glad we had done Top of the Rock during the day as it was a great contrast.,4.0,4.9399999999999995
4746,Not for the faint hearted,"Previously up to the 86th floor, i thought this building was high. Going on up to the 102nd floor, i panicked when i saw how far i was up. Looking down is not for the faint hearted, but you do get a great view of new york. Well worth the trip.",5.0,4.7282

4749,Amazing views but prepare to wait if you go on a clear day,"Amazing views from the top, if a bit windy! Also went to Top of the Rock, must admit their queuing system was better as you were given an allotted time slot to return for and there was some interesting information on boards on the walls as you did queue a bit - if anything didn't have enough time to read them all, Empire State visit could be improved if it did the same. We arrived on the first clear day after 3 days of cloud so did expect queues but overall our visit took just under four hours and that's quite a long time when you're only in the city for a few days and there's so much to see, still wouldn't have missed it for the world.",4.0,4.7946
4750,50th birthday visit,Excellent and superbly organised attraction..staff incredibly friendly and helpful. Will recommend to anyone to visit this iconic attraction,5.0,4.8818
4751,Awesome experience,"My husband and I have visited New York City once or twice a year for the last 40 years or so and it had been decades since we last took the trip to the top of the Empire State Building. Having heard that it had been recently renovated, we thought it was time to do it again. What an awesome experience! We were there at sunset and the view just doesn't disappoint! The process was very efficient and it was so cool to hear all the different languages spoken by tourists from from far and near who were likewise appreciating this iconic American city. The building itself is a wonder of construction, human ingenuity and fortitude; truly an amazing feat! Don't miss this!",5.0,4.9526
4752,Great first visit for my granddaughter,"My teenage granddaughter was impressed with information in the museum, the walls of famous visitors and of corse the views. We were fortunate to go late afternoon and the crowds were not as large as earlier in the day. A great end before going to theater.
Beautiful views and one of the best of NYC.",5.0,4.9190000000000005

Will definitely visit it again when in NYC",5.0,4.9246
4754,Empire State Building at night,"I don’t have a head for heights so was very apprehensive. While it was still a challenge I could not help but be impressed by the views of New York at night. The museum area was well laid out and informative. You are herded through the gift shop at the end (which always bugs me) and the breadth of tat to purchase was staggering but easy to decline.

Overall a great experience",5.0,4.9338

The queue was not too long and it moves pretty quick , we choice to go to the 102 nd floor , the great side of that is when you come down to the next viewing platform you don’t have to join the long queues to get down to floor level , . Spectacular views we were luck as it was a very sunny day . Very welcoming staff helpful , friendly.",5.0,4.9622

4759,Bucket List Item,"Truly unmissable for those of us who remember the Empire State as the tallest building in the world.

Passing by we could see the queues were manic at certain times.....early morning.....sunset.

We watched the weather and at approximately 4pm on a beautiful clear blue sky day we headed up. There was no queue to speak of. A simple and informative museum greets all vsitors and keeps you entertained if queing. Views are spectacular and you are not time limited at the top.

As with everything in New York the cost of the attreaction is ridiculously overpriced. THe Empire State is not a viable building without the visitors to the viewing platform.",5.0,4.8260000000000005
4760,Wonderful,"We really enjoy it. It was an amazing experience for all the family.
More restrooms are needed, as there was a long queue, and a cheaper ticket would be appreciated.",4.0,4.7816

4762,Worth another visit if you haven't been in awhile,"It had been a few years since we'd been to the Empire State Building but were in NYC with friends who had never been and it was high on their to-do list. Decided to come in the evening to avoid the crowds and it was such a good decision. We went around 11:30pm and there was literally no one in line, no one at all - so we didn't need to spend the extra money on the front of line tickets. The ESB has been completely re-done - there are great new exhibits with video technology integrated into most of the exhibits and it really adds a lot to the overall experience. It is a must-do for sure if you haven't been in a few years.",5.0,4.7614
4763,Pretty good visit,"Great experience, no lines, clear day, nice staff, incredible views.
Went on my own, no passes to skip lines.",5.0,4.4538
4764,Well worth a visit,We didn’t have a pre book ticket but as it happened we didn’t need one. We went straight in and once past security no queuing at all. We weren’t rush once at the top and views were amazing. Wee worth a visit!,5.0,4.8268
4765,Fab views but just queue after queue.,Visibility was non existent for most of the time we were in New York so the only clear day was on our last. We made a last minute decision to visit at night. Once we bought our tickets (7) - which was very easy - we then starter to queue for the security checks. Once through security we then had to queue to go through the ticket barrier. It was not very clear that there were 2 lanes so everyone queued in one the a member of staff called people from the back of the queue to join the second lane therefore allowing them to jump ahead of others waiting. Once we got through the barrier we then had to queue for the lift.which only went to the 80th floor where we then...you guessed it.... we had to queue for another lift to reach the observation deck. Once we got there the views of New York at night were fabulous. Then there were the queues for the lifts to return to ground level which moved far quicker then when going up. The whole system did not appear to be very well organised.,2.0,4.9144000000000005

4768,The view is sensational,We did both this and the One World Trade observatory and I thought the view from the Empire State Building was better as there was no glass hindering it. We went about half an hour before sunset and saw the best of both worlds - the crowds are intense but make sure to get the skip the queue pass. Take your time and take it all in!,5.0,4.4925999999999995
4769,Amazing,"Very safe, the view of the city is incredible, I enjoyed it very much. It is the top of the world, you can see all the neighborhoods of New York",5.0,4.614
4770,1st Visit,Expect long queues unless you go Fast track which is more money which I think is quite poor as everyone should be treated the same. Got to the scanner for tickets and tbh you could have just walked in as we had 3 tickets on my phone but only managed to scan 1 before a member of staff rudely said you can stand here you are holding the queue up! That said was a lovely experience but preferred the Rock.,4.0,2.6996
4771,Granddaughter Birthday,"If was my granddaughter's 11th birthday and her first visit to th Empire State Building. She absolutely loved it.

4778,AMAZING AT NIGHT,"What’s not to love about the most iconic building in New York and the attraction itself did not disappoint. We booked the Explorer Pass and chose this as one of our attractions. There’s plenty to see and watch as you climb the 1st couple of floors with state of the art videos playing and lots of interesting facts and pictures to look at. There’s even a visit from King Kong himself via an immersive video experience playing great fun for kids and adults alike, then you get in to the elevator to the top where you are greeted with simply stunning views. We decided to go at night as we wanted to see New York in all its glitz and WOW. there are plenty of heat lamps running around the whole of the observatory deck so even in this weather you can keep warm but to be honest you’ll just be blown away by the sights and sounds to even realise it’s cold. This is simply a MUST DO ATTRACTION. You cannot come to New York and not visit the Empire State Building",5.0,4.9512
4779,Autumn visit to NY,"Arrived in NY from PEI, Canada to spend week with British cousin who has lived in NY for over thirty years. Son and his family travelled from UK to spend the week in NY also. We had the most wonderful time and sharing all the visits with two teenagers was just such a fun, happy time. Saw New York skyline at sunset from Empire State building which was just a magical experience.",5.0,4.8598
4780,Nice,"Nice, but way to expensive. 42 dolars just to climb and there were thousands of people overall, so you couldnt enjoy completely the landscape. But, is ok... I guess.",3.0,2.1052
4781,No view,"Spent nearly $250 on 4 AM/PM tickets for a selected date. On the morning we visited there was no view but we were allowed to ascend. They shut the attraction later in the day which begs the question as to whether it should have been open earlier in the day. We were unable to use the PM part of our ticket and the AM trip was a waste of money, apart from the museum. In these circumstances, are refunds offered? I have emailed esbnyc but no response so far. I would advise against pre-booking and committing to a date in case the weather is poor. The man on the door in the evening could offer no advice about redeeming our PM ticket on a different date during our stay.",2.0,1.275
4782,The view is worth the wait,"We have been to the Empire State Building a number of times but as we were visiting with NYC first timers....

The wait was very long and they didn’t manage the queue very well. We did get a fantastic view. Things are changing in Manhattan. The skyline is very different. Lovely sunny day so visibility was great. See photos!

We bought a CityPass so didn’t have to queue for a ticket. We just scanned our passes.

You have to go if you are in NYC for the first time, but if I am honest I preferred Top of the Rock this time.",4.0,4.9742

4789,My dream came true,"I was happy to reach my destination, I said to myself., I’m here at last. Now which door is the entrance, as I was not sure and a few other people following me. We had a very rood door man, he was young and very tall shouting at us and saying its closed‘ I thought he meant you can’t go up to the top today’ we all looked at each other, then I said so we can’t get to the top today? he then said not this way it’s closed. When you get out the door turn right and you’ll find the entrance. He left us all confused at first. Anyway 15mins later we arrived, then more shouting from the security people, ( like at the airport) telling us to take off our coats, hats, bags. Which is fair enough, But all that drama took away the romance of this iconic building. Eventually I got back to my happy zone and enjoyed all the surprises and amazing views to come. The history of how it was built was outstanding. My favourite was the King Kong filming of him looking in the window. It was a cloudy day but it was still amazing and I’m so GLAD I made it.",5.0,4.9876000000000005

And then also the ""diving"" into the movies, which were shot there and the ""meeting"" with king kong! :) And at the end: the roof and the incredible view it self!! There is nothing more to say, you just have to see it for yourself! enjoy it! You will never forget it!",5.0,4.8246
4792,Amazing view of NYC skyline!,What an incredible iconic site to visit in NYC! It should on your #1 place to visit as it gives you the best view of the city and take post card or movie like pics at the observation level. It is worth the cost of $50+ per person. Highly recommend a visit for anyone.,5.0,4.786
4793,Long lines and unhappy staff,"The line was eternal and there was no way of knowing whether you were already there or the elevator doors would open and you'd have to wait for another hour. Also whenever you had a question, the staff was in a bad mood and answered violently. Did not feel welcome at all. But in the end, the views are stunning and it's a good experience to be up there.",2.0,3.6188000000000002

4795,Horrible wait,"horrible waiting from outside and inside the building, very long wait in a normal line, multiple barriers to advance, and if you want to walk fast you have to pay 3 times more ..... it gives a feeling of claustrophobia, you can not easily leave at a certain point ... you have to reach the end. .With children it is fatal to wait",1.0,1.5158
4796,Unexpectedly enjoyable experience,I am a 63 year old man and I had not visited the observation deck of the Empire State Building since the 1980s. My cousin invited my wife and me to join her for her first visit to the 102nd floor. I had no idea that the space had recently undergone a major renovation. I highly recommend a visit to the observation deck and the add-on visit to the 102nd floor (and the new immersive experience before the elevator ride to the top). This now ranks as one of the top tourist attractions in New York.,5.0,4.5001999999999995

4799,Worth it,Arrived early in the morning as it was just a few minutes walk from our hotel. As it was shortly after 9:00 there was virtually no queue so we got to the 86th floor pretty quickly. The museum displays on the way to the lifts was really interesting. The views were spectacular and the free telescopes were really well placed. Delighted my wife chose this attraction.,5.0,4.8994

4801,Excellent morning,"I'll start this review by saying we came here on a day of absolutely atrocious weather. It was horrific. You could barely see anything of the city, apart from a few times you caught a glimpse of it through the clouds that blew past below us at 100 miles an hour.

Standing outside at the top of the ESB was an experience to behold. Being from Wellington, NZ, I'm used to wind - we are the windiest city in the world (officially), but it was almost as bad up the top of the ESB.

What made it special out there though was that we were at the ESB. It was great. There was no one out there - including my wife. I managed to get her out for a few of minutes but that was about it. I walked around and soaked it up. No one, absolutely no one, and I've been there when there are people out there. This beat it by miles. As did the absolutely no lines to get up the top, not a single person stood in our way. The security guards opened the doors for me and I stood there just loving it.

To sum up, it was an experience and maybe not the one everyone wants. For my wife and I though the time saving, and the fact we'd been to the Top of the Rock to see the skyline, including with the ESB, it made it something very special.

If you're an adventurer, and the weather is total s**t, this is a worthy, and time saving, option.",5.0,4.912
4802,Express pass more than worth it!,For my birthday my boyfriend and I got bought express tickets and it was the best idea! Beat all of the queues and even had red carpets to walk on. We got there at 430 and made it to the top in 10 minutes so had plenty of time to see the sunset,5.0,4.4848

Then take the elevator to the 82nd floor. What a view. You see all the New York highlights. Take your time to take it in.
Look at the movies that are recorded here.
Then go up to the 102nd floor.
Beautiful!
Not cheap but worth every dime!",5.0,4.1394

There is a sense of humour added to make your visit not only informative but fun when you enter the lift to the 86th floor and iff, you know your movies, you will love what comes after (will not spoil it if you haven't been yet)! I cannot stop raving about my time at the Empire state building to all and sundry if you haven't been and you have the chance it's an absolute must! Loved it👍",5.0,4.965

4824,A must do when in NY,"Great attraction, interesting tour on way through/up & superb views of NY. Super quick lifts. Only grumble would be the price of the token professional picture ($26) is these were less ($10-15) sure they'd sell more.",5.0,4.9258

4833,Amazing building,It’s a must for anyone going to NYC the only negative thing would be I purchased a New York pass and visibility non existent the day I wanted to go so left to the next and last day of trip and although clear on ground level emerged into a cloud at top so would recommend you buy as you go to avoid disappointment that said it’s managing inside lovely history and although we missed out on amazing views wasn’t upset as got to see the views from top of the rock.,5.0,3.7548

No longer floodlit at night- they have upgraded to LED lighting which is spectacular and changes frequently. Amazing views from up here- day and night.

4854,Exhibit on the way up better than the view,"We went to Empire State Building using the New York Pass which I HIGHLY recommend.

We went midday and experienced no cues. They did hold onto a padlock I happened to have in my bag so expect to be security checked.

I throughly enjoyed the exhibit on the way up to the top, more than the actual view itself. The view from Top of the Rock was better. The wire really hinders photos.

Not the highlight of NYC for me but definitely worth it if you have a one of the passes to see multiple attractions.",4.0,4.873
4855,Amazing view of Manhattan uo there,a good way to discover the surroundings. + numerous restos just downstreet. The waiting for the lift up to the roof is an attraction of its own with some classical images of the building's construction,5.0,4.4192

4867,Unprofessional crowd management,"Be ready to wait, and wait, then wait again. You wait to get in the building, then up the stairs, then through TSA-like security, then to go through the turnstyle, then walk across a museum then another line to get through a movie room and a King Kong exhibit, then a line again for the elevator, then another line for another elevator. And then of course you have to wait to go back downstairs in two separate elevators rides.

There is no organization. Staff doesn't care, lines aren't clearly defined, the retractable belt lines are not connected, rude tourists skip the line, etc.",2.0,3.1514

4871,ESB....loved it!,"The iconic Empire State Building has such presence in Manhattan, walking along 5th Avenue from Washington Square Park to Central Park there it is.....larger than life! The view from the top is breathtaking and well worth the trip. No need to pre-book just turn up. We use the City Pass when visiting New York as makes things a little more reasonable. For me I wouldn’t feel like I’d been to New York if I didn’t go up the ESB.... it’s my very favourite building in NYC",5.0,4.6244

4884,Be aware of the weather,Have done this trip a few years ago but on a recent trip was made aware of the weather affecting your visit. We were doing a bus trip and noticed and confirmed that the drizzling rain and low cloud meant going to the top today would be a waste of time . You can normally pick up tickets same day or day before but advise check weather first as non refund policy appears to be in place due to weather,4.0,1.738

4888,The New York icon. Must do,Been up the ESB a few times and it always delivers even though the observatory on freedom tower outdoes it now. But the queues are short early morning and the exhibitions on the way in are great. And it took 13 months to build. Wow!,4.0,4.8814

4891,Great attraction far too many people,Great attraction and really happy that we visited ..... massive thank you to Julius (security) for helping us at the top of the building ... the only thing that let it down for us was there were far too many people bumping into you and jostling you.. (not great for someone who doesn’t like being touched) ...,4.0,4.9452

4895,worth the wait,"Unable to go up on our first attempt due to cloud cover, consequently on our 2nd visit we experienced long queues. ideal time to visit is 8am or after 4pm . on my last trip 10 years ago they gave you an audio tape and head phones to help you pick out different buildings and sites across the city, this wasn't available this time which made the experience less informative!!!",4.0,4.5782
4896,Unforgettable,Wow. I hadn’t been to the ESB in over 10 years. I bought my tickets online and took my kids for their first time last weekend. I was so impressed with the whole exhibit! They did an excellent job really making you feel a part of the history and it’s creation. There were endless photo opportunities- and that was before we even got to the 86th floor and the gorgeous views! I will definitely do this again and recommend it to anyone visiting ! Even my 6 and 10 year old are listing it as one of their favorite things we did on our visit to NYC.,5.0,4.9643999999999995

4898,Still wows,An absolute must! Get there early on a clear day and avoid the crowds. Polite staff who are very knowledgeable help to make your visit something you will never forget.,5.0,4.3054
4899,Not its former self,This was iconic landmark (still is) before any other buildings topped its vertical limits and that was probably in the 80s. Many skyscrapers (in nyc and internationally) had been surpassing it and one can feel Empire State holding onto its previous glory these days. The herald square area has not been a premier location for decades. The building itself is dated. Other than serving as a basic office building there’s really not too much allure left of this once upon a time mighty destination. Think of this building’s destiny as one that mimics nyc as a whole.,3.0,4.1718
4900,Amazing views.,"This building and the reason people visit is all about the views.
They are (watch the forecast and pick a clear day or eve) spectacular views.

The cost, like many of NYC attractions, is extorinate so pick your personal 'must do's' and plan ahead.

We decided not to do Rockerfeller due to similarity and cost.

It is a lovely building with so much history and worth a visit.",4.0,4.8236
4901,Movie theme?,"There are so many movies run through my mind when I looking over the NY Central Park. Feeling I am here again!!! This is New York!

4903,No waiting lines in October,This is not my first time visiting but much has changed in 20 years. The elevators are many and fast and the exhibition is great (didn’t exist when I first visited) and of course the view on top is priceless. An iconic building a must stop when in NYC.,5.0,4.4454

4906,far better than I expected,plenty to see - the history on how the building came about and was built was very interesting. The new 'King Kong' area is fun but the main thing is the view... we were lucky to go on a clear day.... the view was unbelievable... and this has to be a Must Do on anyones visit to the area,5.0,4.7638
4907,I liked it ;),"Everything is very well organised, the view is amazing in the night, but the ticket is a little to expensive for many tourists.",4.0,3.952

4909,Visit to the Observation floor.,"Staff were not a patch on The Top of the Rock staff ! They were disinterested and not very helpful. The wait was 90 minutes to the first elevator stop then there was a 30 minute wait for the next elevator. We chose to walk up seven flight to the observation deck! Had the same problem coming down. They allowed too many people up there! We did witness a young English couple get engaged with a proposal on the observation deck though.
Would not recommend this trip!",3.0,1.5254
4910,Amazing views from this iconic building,Loved our visit to the Empire State Building. We went early morning to access before 8am with our Explorer Passes as this was a special entry time when we were in New York. We did not really have to queue for long at all. We loved the film posters and the information about how the building was built and my daughter loved the King King section. When we reached the top the views were amazing. We must have been up there for around 45 minutes looking at all the views and getting all the photos we wanted. Loved looking through the binocular viewing points as well. Early morning was a great time to visit as the sun was shining on the water making the views even more spectacular. The shop on the way down was great and we picked up some great souvenirs and gifts. All the staff were very friendly and happy to chat and answer questions. Very well presented as well. Highly impressed.,5.0,4.9896

When you get into the elevator to take you to the 80th floor there is a brilliant film showing on the ceiling that shows the building being built as you go up. It is a must to video, the rest of the trip I will leave for you to experience it will not let you down.",5.0,4.6228
4913,An icon you have to visit,"Unbelievably there were no queues - it was a wednesday afternoon visit.

4916,Classic place to visit that’s magnificent,"If you do NYC, you must include the Empire State Building in your itinerary. Apart from the views which are truly amazing, there’s a fascinating exhibition. If you can, climb the 7 stairs to the top and back down, rather than queuing for the lifts. Also, despite parental anxieties, it’s safe for kids too.",5.0,4.873
4917,The Spirit of NY!,"The Empire State Building of NY is the spirit of NY. There are many icons in NY this is one of them. Visiting that building is unlike visiting any other modern building anywhere else in the world, its a special monument with lots of history and feelings. Seeing the building and being inside it takes you immediately back in time in seconds you smell history every where from the entrance to the top of the building....
Both the Empire State and the Chrysler Builds are spirits of NY City.
Wont regret spending a whole day around it!",5.0,4.5596
4918,Best NYC experience if you're not from NYC!,"Yeah, I know…you guys have been waiting for my review before deciding if you should visit the Empire State Building in NYC. Yeah, ya should.
First off, this building was completed in 1931 (2 years later, King Kong climbed it, ok, not really, but the film came out 2 years later). It was built in a record 13 ½ months during the Great Depression. It was the tallest building in the world from 1931 until 1970. It’s been featured in more than 250 movies.
The main observatory deck is on the 86th floor; the 102nd floor is also open, but is really not a much different view than the 86th floor, with the disadvantage of being enclosed (but if you’re only going to visit once, do both!).
About the price: no bargains here: 58 bucks for an adult ($52 for a child, $56 for a senior)—not cheap (“express pass” costs even more!). They’re open from 8AM until 2 AM, but the best views are in the afternoon/evening when the city is all lit up, but you can’t go wrong any time you visit because, being in midtown Manhattan, the ESB has some of the most memorable vistas of NYC.
If you’re going there for a romantic rendezvous, go in the evening. I've taken many dates here, and they all loved it.",5.0,4.752
4919,Great visit but crowded,Express ticket definitely worth the price. Especially with kids. The top was so crowded it was hard to get a view but pushed our way in. Gorgeous building!!,5.0,4.7238
4920,Do not go u less you fast pass,"Honestly the worst line management ever. Seems they tried with an elevator demo and king Kipling interactive moment - but hot, unorganized, easy for people to move in front of you, takes FOREVER. By the time we got to the top (walking the last 7 flights of stairs because the line to the next elevator would have sent us all over the ledge) we were all annoyed and exhausted.
But clearly the view was amazing.",2.0,4.645
4921,Advance Tickets don't wait in line,"It's worth paying the extra $$ for skip the line tickets and going to the 102 floor!! Just make sure when you're at ""king kong"" floor to go to advanced ticket line. We almost waited with ""regular"" ticket ppl bc elevator guide just shuffled ppl in that direction.

4928,A New York Icon,"The observation deck is worth visiting as you get a full view of New York City. This is a New York landmark and definitely a tourist trap. It can be very pricey for admission and there's a 3D movie, which is another fee and the stimulation ride, which also is another fee. Note: For visitors, who are prone to motion sickness prone, do NOT get on the stimulation ride as you'll be sick. It's worse than a roller coaster. It's crowded at times and you may not be able to get a good spot for a viewing of at the rooftop.

This is a New York icon.",5.0,2.5474
4929,Empire State Building,"Many changes to this experience than my first visit nearly 30 years ago, although the queues are still as horrendously long. Very enjoyable and the views are always better than expected. It is certainly worth the wait to be above the helicopters!

4930,Empire State Building - first time visit from Ireland.,"I was fortunate to get a clear cloudless day for my visit. I was pleasantly surprised to find so much information about the planning and design of the building before I ascended. Then the view from the top platform was amazing. The organisation is good, queue was not too long and moved rapidly.
All in all a super experience.",5.0,4.9356

4932,Still the best,"There certainly are other high rise sightseeing venues in NYC but, for me, the Empire State still provides the best experience, especially through the south facing uncluttered sight of Downtown Manhattan.
Also, don't forget to check it at night, New York lights seen from above are an experience not to be missed, in my opinion.",5.0,4.7928
4933,Should have a control on the number of people,"I've been in Empire State during a morning in 2016 and it was beautiful and perfect.
This time I've visit the place at 7 pm of a saturday (not sure the exact time but it was night); it was impossible to get into the elevator; the place where you have Kong's ""exposition"" you couldnt even stop to watch because people was occupying the whole place walking into the elevators.
When I finally get into the first stop, you couldn't even walk around, not to take a picture, you couldn't walk around to see the views, or to go down.
After spend 5 minutes, i decide to go out from the place, and guess what? the hall to go down was full of people, half to go down and half to go up to the upper floor... there was no line... nothing.
It was a terrible expirience... So I recommend you not to go on a saturday night",2.0,4.8474

4937,Impressive visit.,"This was a very good experience although the views were non existent due to low cloud (which nobody can do anything about). There was a very well presented display, about the building of the Empire State Building, on the way in. Certainly glad I've done it.",5.0,4.6708
4938,Possibly my favourite tourist thing to do.,"Sure, there is the Obsertvatory downtown which is 102 floors high, but this building is an Origional and you can go outside on the 86th floor and breath the fresh air, hear the sounds of NYC below and right in the centre of Manhattan. It feels like this should be the very first thing you do as after this, you have a great idea of NYC layout and the size of the city and buildings. Yes...definately go here. My son of 12 and 7 years ago his brother who was 12 then both loved it. Adults or kids it's a must!

4940,"Great views, better photos than WTC as no windows",We took a chance and visited on a cloudy and windy day and had no queues. There were only about 20 people at the top so we could move around easily. If you can see the top of the building from below then you should have a view from the top. The clouds gave some dramatic photos. We visited the WTC at night time on a clear day the night after but the photos were not as good due to reflections in the glass. There is no glass at the Empire State.,5.0,2.3596

I highly recommend you go all the way to the top and go outside, but if you’re going in the Fall, make sure you dress warm as it is frigid up there. The lines weren’t very long (10 minute wait at max) when we went in the evening. Also, don’t be alarmed if it feels like the building is swaying slightly, you’re safe! :) Check it out, you won’t regret it!",5.0,4.8852
4943,Monday Visit,Well what can I say the whole experience was the best ever the building it's self is monument to Art Deco the history and architecture is fantastic..the staff are helpful and friendly.I would recommend this experience above anything else in NYC.

4944,Amazing!,"We were totally blown away by our visit to the Empire State Building. The new 2nd floor museum was very well done and really informative and interesting. It is amazing that it was built in 13 months! All the exhibits, videos, props and stories told the incredible story of how it was built. We also did the 86th floor observation deck and the new 102nd floor observation deck at sunset and got some really great pictures. I highly recommend it! Incredibly well done!",5.0,4.9236

4957,Stunning views in an iconic setting.,Empire state Building is so iconic you can not miss out visiting whilst in New York. We booked any time tickets which were great as we could go in any time which helped us as when you fit so much in on a day and not sure what time you will arrive. We went around 4pm and although we had fast track tickets - there was no queues and in fact our 'fast' line took longer to access as the lady in front had one plastic card ticket to access for six people and it kept going wrong! Out of all the building we went to this was over the quickest. Seemed less to see? my daughter loved King Kong feature but even though not busy it took quite a while to get photo opportunity.,4.0,4.5608
4958,Visit of the 86th floor,"Too many people were present on the terrace which made the traffic very difficult and the access to the edge was also very complicated because the people who were there, were clinging to it and refused to move.

Very, very VIP treatment and experience. Highly recommend this tour!",5.0,4.9716000000000005
4962,Great views,Have been upto the observatory tower before but was keen to re-visit from the highly publicised glass elevator. The elevator went up to the 102nd floor but it wasn't a glass elevator so not quite the advertised experience. Visited the Empire State around lunchtime with no queues so a better time to go than first thing in the morning. Amazing views of NYC but at $70 each do not a cheap outing,3.0,4.7976

4965,Spectacular Views,"Just returned from a trip to New York and this was on my husband's to do list. To be honest I wasnt that bothered as I am terrified of heights but I decided to go up and see for myself.

The views are spectacular and look fabulous even when standing in the middle!

The information and facts and figures on how it was built was fantastic and to see the screenplays with the workers was quite lovely.

We were lucky in that there was no queues (we went at 10am) so was in and out in no time.

My husband thought the whole experience was brilliant and he did take some wonderful shots of the whole of New York City.",4.0,4.9632000000000005

4968,What an experience,Walked in off the street on the off chance and asked how long the queue was apparently it was 45 minutes. However we only waited 30 and what an amazing journey literally. We decided to go the extra floors to 102 and I have to say it was worth every dollar.,5.0,4.5434
4969,Good view but make us use stairs to get on top,"We went to Empire State. View is great.
Bad stuff was they take us until floor 81th and then they said we have to wait 45 min for elevator or we can take stairs. We did stairs.
I think they should plan better because it was so much people there.",3.0,4.0846
4970,Great experience,Enjoyed the experience before the ascent. The history and how the building was constructed was informative and help understand the building better. Great theming,5.0,4.8372

It was a warm sunny day when we visited and the views were spectacular.There were quite a lot of people there but not so many as to prevent me getting some nice pictures from all sides. The one minor irritation, as with all tourist spots these days, is the selfie stick brigade.
I would have liked to return to see this at night but our time was limited.",5.0,3.9534000000000002
4972,Exceptional views - a must do in NYC,"Would highly recommend visiting in the evening after dark, as the views across the city are spectacular. It seems that the lines are less busy then too, and the building is open until 2am. The staff have the process of getting the many visitors up and down the elevators well executed, and waits were not too long.",5.0,4.1968
4973,Brilliant views of NYC,"Must see place in New York.
Make sure it’s a clear day.
Advise get there early to avoid queues if in the morning opens at 8am.

Lifts very fast.
Observation deck is busy but 360 degrees of all of Manhattan. Amazing views.
Well worth it. It’s so New York.

Well worth it",5.0,4.8873999999999995
4974,An icon,The queues can be long if you don’t have the express pass. The observatory opens at 0800hrs but the doors open at about 0745hrs so it’s worth being there just after 0730hrs to beat the queues especially during the weekend. The information provided at the lobby is really interesting and then the first lift takes you to the 76th floor. There is more to read here but you can do that after you come down from the viewing platform on the 86th. You take a second lift up to the 86th and there can be a queue for it too. The views of NY are amazing from the viewing platform. Go up on a clear day though or you will see nothing. Highly recommended.,5.0,4.8718

4978,Slightly Exceeded Expectations,"Loved visiting the iconic site. Recommend it as a tourist destination for the history and the view. The view was beautiful from the main observatory deck and the 102nd floor. We went on the opening day of the 102nd floor, which was really cool. The floor itself is a small circle with walls made of glass. They did a great job with moderating the amount of people on the 102nd floor to allow for plenty of space to move around. Only negative was the amount of people in the attraction and waiting in long lines to reach the observatory and 102nd floor.",4.0,4.9076
4979,3rd Time in ESB but 1st in 16 years.... what a change! Time to go back!,"There's nothing I can say that you would already know from other reviews or general knowledge. Yes the views, yes great staff but what I found amazing was how much it had changed inside since our last visit 16 years ago. If you haven't been in a while, it's time to go again.

Yes the building is still the building and of course the view changes as the local buildings do but the last time I visited you queued then had the choice to do a simulator on your way to two sets of lifts to the top. That was it. Now the experience on the way to the top is so well developed. There's the history of the building, interactive sections, the buildings appearances in movies and tv and more.

We were on a limited time frame in NYC and we had no choice but to visit on a misty day and nearly all staff tried to talk us out of going up which was great. It made you feel they genuinely wanted you to have a great experience.

I proposed at the top of the ESB and 16 years on, I went back with my wife and daughter for another great experience.",5.0,4.979
4980,Express pass is worth it,I’ve read other reviews about the express pass and seen some for and some against spending the extra money. I went on a Friday around 5 p.m. in early November. I would guess I saved a minimum of 3 hours of standing in line by getting the pass. Well worth it. You can chance there not being a lot of people but you will regret not getting it when it’s busy.,5.0,2.8456

4986,View from the Iconic Empire State Building,Always a great experience! Pay to go up to the 86th floor observation deck and you will really enjoy the view especially on a clear day. I would not waste the extra $ to go all the way to the very top (102nd floor).,5.0,4.8598

We did not have to que long to get to the top or coming down.

5001,My first visit to The Empire State Bldg.,"I’ve been to NYC a zillion times, but I never made the time to visit this site. This last time, I was determined to visit the top of this gorgeous historical building. We waited for a clear night and visited then. The lines were inexistent and after viewing some photos in the first floor that depict part of the history of the building, we purchased tickets easily in one of many ticket machines. Then, with out having to wait, we were ushered right into an elevator to a predetermined floor with more exhibits on the history of the building. Everything is run very well. Attendants along every area. The recreation of the King Kong exhibit was amazing. The windows show King Kong moving from (fake) window to window as if he was truly just outside. Very cool. Then, once done with this section, we proceeded to the viewing open platform many floors above. The view was spectacular. with a crystal clear night, one could see all the lights and buildings below perfectly well. It was breathtaking! I loved it! Would recommend this to anyone coming to NYC. The building is iconic and historical. It’s also gorgeous inside and one can appreciate the architectural beauty as one moves around its interior. It was grand!",5.0,4.9956

5005,VIP Tour Is The Way To Go!,"My mother and I recently booked this VIP tour and we were blown away. We expected a little special treatment here and there, but nothing like what we received. I had been to the Empire State Building before but it was my mother's first visit. We were greeted in the lobby by Renita E who, in my opinion, made the tour. She was so warm and made us feel like celebrities. We were taken to a private lounge, given champagne and regaled with stories of the Empire's history and art. She acted as our personal photographer, escorting us the front of all the lines and capturing pictures of every moment. Everything has been recently remodeled and all the exhibits transported you from the early days of the monument up to recent days of visiting dignitaries and stars. I have never felt such a personal connection to a tour host. By the end of our visit Renita felt like part of the family. I think meeting her was as much a delight as the tour itself. She brought the whole place to life for us in a way I had never experienced before. The VIP Experience is so worth it if you're able to do it, especially if you can get Renita herself! Amazing experience!",5.0,4.968

5011,Amazing views at night,"We visited the Empire State Building at night. The queuing was a little disorganised and we took the stairs to the top rather than waiting the 30 minutes for the lift even though the queue wasn’t that long.
The building is lovely with the Art Deco features and the view from the top in breathtaking!
An unmissable attraction in New York.",5.0,4.8268
5012,Great visit,Beautiful day and an amazing visit. The building is so 1930s. It’s fabulous. It’s a must if you are visiting New York.,5.0,4.8148

5014,Monday morning 9AM almost no waiting line!,We visited the empire state at a monday morning at 9AM. Altough the ‘sellers’ on the street said it would be busy and we should buy the special no waiting line tickets. We were on the top in about 15 minutes. And the route was full entertainment. Almost like a museum. View from the top was nice! When we returned on streetlevel at around 10:30AM the waiting line was very much longer. People were waiting on the street and even around the block!,5.0,4.644
5015,Very nice. But needs more restrooms and signs to it.,Was actually very beautiful nice and enjoyable. But the fact that I needed a bathroom and was so hard to find one. And there's very little toilets. That is a basic to accommodate so much people it had to be much more restrooms.,3.0,4.0168
5016,"Great views day and night, kind staff during the day","We visited the empire state building in the morning and evening. What fascinated me and my wife was not only the views, but the difference in staff attitude in the evening. Everyone was so much nicer during the day!

But of course we do not go there to see the staff but to see the amazing views from the building which didn’t disapoint!

A must see when visiting NYC",4.0,4.8404
5017,An amazing view,Very well laid out attraction. It was not peak season so there is minimal crowd and the tour was very quick to complete. A tour guide explaining the different land marks would have been very useful or at least a recorded guide to accompany the tour.,4.0,4.6436

5019,Empire State a must do!,"We enjoyed this immensely. The views are amazing and it is a must do when in NYC.

My only issue was with the staff who were ushering us into lines for elevators and stairs. They came across so rude and literally angry at customers. It did put a downer on the evening for us as we were so taken back by their lack of customer service. One make staff member was observed to be shouting at us within the group and rolling his eyes. Not acceptable. Also he was overheard shouting loudly “this is why I didn’t want to be here today” and gestured at the group.",4.0,2.0722

5021,Return to the Empire State,"Visited 13 years ago so 2nd visit. New internal exhibits were good. Better speed to get through security.
Commentary on the sites wasn’t as good as 13 years ago. Previously you had a New York Italian tell you about the views and you followed the commentary numbers. Selecting the points to hear about didn’t work for me. Kept repeating the same commentary when I selected different points so gave up as not really getting the same experience as the old one was better. 9/11 museum commentary worked better!",4.0,4.89

Great experience!",5.0,4.9318

5035,Day and Night Visit,Used City Pass so had option to use Day and go again the same night. With winter hours starting at 8pm we managed to do both with the children. The queues were short day and night and we’d checked weather forecast so got clear stunning views on both visits. Kids loved King Kong which wasn’t there when I last visited 10 years ago.,5.0,4.7278

5042,Great views of New York,"We went to the Empire State Building as it was one of the places our son had been desperate to visit. The views are stunning and we had a great time once we reached the observation floor. The only negative was that we had booked for a Monday and the day before the weather was very bad so that meant that it was very busy so we didn’t really get to enjoy the experience getting up to the top floor as a lot of time queuing and not really able to stop and take time to take photos of the exhibits on the way around as too crowded, but the view and experience of being at the top of the Empire State Building is what was important and that was excellent.",4.0,4.7184

5048,Worst adventure on our NYC trip,"We waited hours to finally reach the observation deck. At $170.00, it was the biggest mistake of my trip with my daughter and 3 Grandchildren. There should be a notice at the bottom of the expected wait time to the top. Nothing much to look at on the way up either.",1.0,2.7439999999999998

5054,Spectacular views,"We visited late October and loved it!
The queues were managed well, with no long waits (maybe 10 minutes max) and the site wasn’t too busy. We had pre-booked the observatory tickets with a time slot (11am) so that helped us skip the initial queue but that didn’t look too big either.
The view was great and for a first time in New York, I would definitely recommend.",5.0,4.8892

At 8am we were at the top, virtually front of the queue so for first 15minutes or do hardly anyone else with us. Timing is crucial to optimise the visit.
The staff were superb. All Uber friendly, Uber New Yorkers and passionate about the building, the city and their roles.
Later that day we went up World One, tallest building in NYC. Didn't compare to the Empire State for us.",5.0,4.958

Went there about an hour before sunset and stayed until half an hour after sunset. The skip the line tickets are recommended during this time of the day.

5079,Definitely worth visiting.,"Tips for visiting the Empire State Building - aim to be at the top just before dusk, the view is incredible with the sun setting and all the lights being turned on but still light enough to see everything!
- I went up on a Tuesday evening and the queue wasn’t so bad, maybe took us 30 mins in total to get to the top. I’ve heard of people queuing hours. Possibly avoid weekends if you can.

And they have the nerve to charge 40+ dollars for all you’re doing is waiting in lines. If you want to see if you can get the same one for free at the top of Rockefeller Center I rarely write a negative review and don’t like doing so but they didn’t have any other choice this was so bad",1.0,1.7912

5123,C'mon it's the Empire State Building,"No trip to New York is complete without a visit to the Empire State Building. I went during darkness around 7pm and the queues were pretty good and quick.
Worth eating in one of the eateries on the ground floor afterwards.",5.0,4.1718
5124,Iconic place to visit,"We visited the Empire State Building around midnight on a recent trip to New York. Even though it was late at night, it was still very busy. We paid for the VIP tickets but I would not recommend these as we didn’t save very much time in the queue. Having said that, if you are visiting on an afternoon in July then you might save more time with the VIP tickets. The night views look amazing. There is more to see and do at ESB than Top of Rock, there is an exhibition about the construction and the building in popular culture. Bear in mind, it could be cold and windy at the top so wrap up warm.",4.0,4.9698
5125,wonderful view but...,"the vie was, as expected, astonishing. Videos with all stars and movies involved in ESB were great, Eminem above all T, set-up with King Kong grabbing you through the window was very funny.
BUT. 40 $ would be the right fee for a 2 hours theatre show, here there was no special exhibition or explanation or whatsoever. It is really too much. half the price would have been fair. not even discount for 2 family members together...",3.0,4.6196
5126,Beautiful view,I've been there several times and it is always an unique experience you can be there at day or night and still will be amazed. One the the must visit places of NYC.,5.0,3.9878
5127,Fun but Crowded.,"Only visit on a clear day. Very crowded but the staff seemngly keep the lines for the elvators moving. 86th floor visit is all that you need. Going to the 102nd floor was interesting but not much different view. found that our ""sightseeing pass"" which included the visit to the Empire State Building is a scam as the operator did not accept it. And do those Hop On/ Hop off busses ever actually move?",4.0,1.9228
5128,Even higher than before!!,"Quick tip...if you pay the xtra bucks to get to FL 102, spend time @ 86 FL FIRST, before heading all the way up so that you don't have to wait on 86 FL line to get back to the bottom ☺",5.0,1.6384
5129,Windy Views,Was visiting the Empire State building in New York for my 50th birthday. You have definitely got to get there early got there at 9:30 walked straight through only five minutes we were at the top amazing views very clean and a great end to a holiday.,5.0,4.9198
5130,Express Pass Visit to Empire State,"I have just returned from a fantastic trip to New York with my 15 year old daughter, we were only there for 4 nights so wanted to see as much as possible. I pre-booked the express passes before our trip......best money spent!!!!! The queues were round the block on an October Monday morning. The sun was out, we were at the top in 5 minutes, the staff made us feel very welcome. The view spectacular!!! Definitely recommend.",5.0,4.8068

5132,"Fantastic views of New York, a must do","As our first time in New York we loved going up the empire state building and seeing the amazing views.

We decided to go at night time to see the lights and we also did the similar top of the rock/Rockefeller centre in the day, so wanted to do one of each. Overall a very good attraction.",4.0,4.886
5133,Jill's 50th birthday,VIP tickets were worth the extra cost to skip the lines which were extremely long. Views great but be sure to book on the day as poor weather easily obscures the view.,5.0,4.5228
5134,Fat bloke meets King Kong,"I was dragged up here as I hate being on tall buildings. I took a while to get in with the tight security but it was worth it. Strangely, the lift impressed me, I only knew I was moving because my ears popped. Breath taking views were to be had, and I especially liked the museum and meeting Mr Kong. I would love to see a full sized statue of him clinging to the side of the building.",5.0,4.8622
5135,Very good,This is my second visit here and it never fails to please. We were lucky that it was a clear day so the views were good. The only negative is the wait time to get to the top. We had pre-booked tickets but so had everyone else!,4.0,3.98
5136,Felt like a theme park ride!,"It took us about 2 hours from the time we got to the building until we got out. The logistics were very good. We really liked all the videos, installations and memorabilia about the construction of the building and how fast they built it. Once you’re at the top, the view is breathtaking. We went at the end of October. The weather was good and we got a nice and clear view, even though there were a few clouds. Highly recommended!",5.0,4.9282
5137,THE Way To Experience The Empire State Building,"On our 1st trip to NYC my husband and I booked many tours, one of which was the Viator Empire State Experience and we could not have been more thrilled! We were able to choose whatever time we wanted and were able to ""skip the lines"" throughout the duration! Now, that doesn't mean we didn't have ""some"" lines, BUT they were completely insignificant compared to the EXTENSIVE LINES we went around! So VERY worth the extra money to move to the front of the line or a different line altogether!

After experiencing beautiful (but insanely crowded) views at sunset and early darkfall, we skipped the exit line and headed down to the Empire State Bar and Grill. With our tickets in hand we had no problems being seated immediately and courteously. The lovely restaurant had ambient lighting with candles on the table, accommodating tables and booths for a bit more privacy (which we reserved!) A lively crowd but not overwhelming as some NYC venues can be. The service by Cynthia and the team was spot-on! We were welcomed and pampered from the minute we walked in to our exit 3 hours later!

The food was probably one of our best meals of our 8-day stay, which really surprised me for some reason! Perhaps because it was a pre-paid, pre-fixe menu, I was expecting less all around but we were overwhelmingly surprised and pleased! The 3-course dinner menu gave an array of choices and were absolutely amazing! The dinner does include a generous pouring of wine or glass of beer, but of course for additional charges, you can have a pre-dinner cocktail---which we did! (Their cosmopolitans are awesome!)

Our dinner consisted of spicy calamari and grilled octopus for appetizers; their lobster ravioli for the entrees and their blueberry pie with sweet corn ice cream and s'mores (deconstructed) for dessert! Amazing! such wonderful offerings with impeccable service!

This was an incredible tour package in every aspect! We had NO TROUBLE understanding the instructions for voucher redemption sent via email by Viator. CLEARLY tells the customer where to enter, where to proceed and what to do. The experience itself was easy to find/follow--- simple and ""painless""! That's what I like!

This tour is so worth every penny! From the customer service prior to, the ""skip the line"" access, to the FABULOUS dinner, this experience does not disappoint! This is truly ""the way"" to experience the Empire State Building!",5.0,4.9956
5138,visit,I visited Empire State building many year ago....but I was very exited about it.... every time. this building is in my heart,5.0,3.0
5139,Very high and thrilling,"Great place to visit, although the queuing to get the top at the lifts meant we walked the last 7 floors to the top. Great place but not fantastic and perhaps not worth the money.",4.0,3.0078
5140,ESB...a must NYC Experience,"A great experience but if you want good photos make sure you go on a clear day. Many people say to go early but I think it’s better in the early afternoon when the sun is a bit higher. We decided the 87th floor was good enough going up to the 102nd floor will make hardly any difference to your view. Queues are longish, even in October, but we only waited about half an hour.",5.0,4.9356
5141,Woorth the $$$,"for anyone that tells you not to do the Empire State because you dont see it when you're in it, I'd say do it because there is so much to see along the way. There's now the addition of the 102nd floor viewing area. There's things of more interest for the children too",5.0,4.019

5145,Pricey tickets and the show was bad,"My fiancé and I were last week (24.10.2019) on the Observatory. We were at 2 pm there, and the weather was very nice. But the show before you get to see the view is actually for the 21st Century bad. At the and of the show you get in a room where you offered to buy a pad where are some information, about the buildings you see on the observatory for $15 per person. That was very rude I think but ok some of the people actually buy them. On the top of the building it was nice but also very crowdy so you had to wait until you can go to the window you want. And the windows made a ""mirror effect"" so many of my picture I have some people on it I don't won't. So it is ok, but the View on top of the rock or a helicopter tour was much better from my opinion.",3.0,4.7036
5146,Perfect Timing,"We waited until early evening on Sunday, which was not crowded. The lines were small and the conditions were perfect. We got through all of the displays and up to the observation deck very quickly.",5.0,4.1438
5147,Rude,"View was beautiful at night, everything was going smooth until we got to the part where you are able to check your photo. The guy handed us the photo to take a look at and as I tried to take a photo of it. instead of saying ""no photos allowed"" he literally SNATCHED it out of my friends hand and continued to smirk. Even his coworker beside him said he was scared. Something needs to be done about that employee. I would never go again or recommend to anyone",2.0,4.645
5148,Sunrise Experience,"I participated in the Empire State Building Sunrise Experience, and it was amazing. It was well worth the price to watch the sun rise over NYC. A couple things of note are the ESB Observation Deck is in the 102 floor, so it is quite chilly in the morning. Also, the entrance for the sunrise experience is in building 20. I went to the main entrance, and the guards directed me around the corner.",5.0,4.5565999999999995

5152,Empire State,"Obviously the view is amazing, staff are helpful, organised and friendly.
Museum is amazing. Our 5 year old loved every minute, especially King Kong, she wanted to go back after spending most of our first day here.",5.0,4.9104
5153,Total tourist trap,The Empire State Building was so crowded with tourists you could hardly get to the barrier to take a photo. Don't waste your time or money. Go to Brooklyn Promenade instead.,1.0,3.42
5154,Great evening with family!,Wonderful evening with family visiting for the first time from Europe! One of my cousins has a srr were ious health issue and could not wait on the long line or do the stairs for the last few floors to the open observatory. The staff was wonderful and helpful in accommodating him so he could get up to see the magnificent views. Thank you all!!!,5.0,4.9138
5155,I would rate this zero if possible,We bought 2 tickets to skip the line and paid for the best they had thinking we were going to the top. After waiting in a long line we were our tickets didn't take us to the top and we would have to start all over and pay an extra twenty dollars. When I went back to check we found Trip Advisor charged us two and a half times what the tickets should have cost. I would go again but buy my tickets there and not through Trip Advisor.,1.0,3.843
5156,Great view.,The view was great up there. The experience matched its reputation. Great place for tourists and couples to have a bird view of the city and enjoy the cool and quietness above high.,5.0,4.8574
5157,Extremely long wait to enter,"Too full... too long a waiting time.. too expensive
For the amount of money and with pre-booking the waiting time was way too long.. the platforms were too full to really enjoy the view.
Top of the Rock was a better experience!",2.0,4.6338
5158,Not a good visit place,"I wasted almost half day here (day admission and night admission). And the price is not worth it. Like seriously??? All there were you would walk through a number of ""art"" display (really???), then they take you to the 86th floor for a helicopter view of Manhattan. Consider the long line, price, and limited (precious?) time, this is the last attraction I would visit.",2.0,1.524
5159,"Amazing views, terrible organisation","The views from the top of the Empire State Building are amazing and definitely memorable. However, there is absolutely zero structure to the touring process,meaning you spend 80% of your time in huge queues (without any structure so its effectively a 'free for all') or peering around people to be able to see the info or photos on display.

I can only compare it to my visit to the Top of the Rock, where you book a time and tour the building in smaller groups which works much better.

I would recommend going to the Empire State Building as its a no brainer whilst in NYC, but even with pre-booked tickets be prepared to wait!",3.0,4.8309999999999995
5160,Absolutely amazing!,"We visited this gorgeous landmark at about 4:30pm on a a Monday and it was the perfect time as it want too busy. When you walk in you can purchase your tickets and head straight off to the museum. Once you have finished looking at the building timelines and information about the building you wait in a queue to get in an elevator. As you go up and up there is a video on the ceiling of the roof showing you the journey of the build. When you reach the 79th floor, you can look out at the amazing view of NYC and wait in another queue to go to the 86th floor. We had the option to go up the 7 more floors via the stairs due to the 25 minute wait for a very short ride in the lift. Once you reach the top there is the option to go into the open area outside and admire the views through the binoculars (for free). There is a fence sort of guard so that smaller children can look out with safety. There are both men's and women's lavatorys on the 86th floor as well as a disabled toilets for both men and women. After we finished we chose the stairs to go back down to the 79th floor and go on a lift ride back down to be welcomed by a gift shop with lots of Empire State building merchandise. Over all it was definitely worth the money and the staff were all incredibly friendly.",5.0,4.9765999999999995

5164,Amazing experience,"We visited the ESb as a family. All, kids and adults, enjoyed the experience of being on top of this iconic building. It was smooth, with helpful staff.

Only glitch was that I paid for 2 photos and was told that i could download them from the website with any number of backgrounds. That was not true, i could get only one of the backgrounds and one with green screen.",4.0,4.4134
5165,Repeat Visitor,We visited the Empire State Building over 40 years ago. It was exciting then and even more so now after the refurbishment.

5174,Great experience!,"My 1st trip to the Empire State Building. I have been to NYC many times, but never wanted to shell out the cash for this experience.
This trip was a family trip and we decided to do it. We bought tickets that included the 102nd floor observatory. What a great experience! The museum on the 2nd floor was great and had lots of interactive things to keep the kids interested. The 86th floor outdoor part was as expected. However, we bundled up thinking it would be cold. There were actually overhead heaters around the entire platform to keep you nice and toasty! But the real gem was the spectacular 102nd floor with floor to ceiling windows. Wow! It was small, but so glad we upgraded to include that! Also, great for people who are in wheelchairs or shorter kids/adults who can't see over the wall on the 86th floor.
Overall, fantastic. If you go early enough, you can avoid the crowds too. 9 am on a Saturday morning was great, but it did get pretty crowded by the time we left.",5.0,4.9902

5179,Amazing views and interesting displays,"I'd highly recommend going to the Empire State Building at night. We found it is open until 2 am so we went after an evening Broadway show. We didn't have to wait in line. There are lots of interactive displays to look at and fun facts to learn. There's a neat ""display"" of King Kong's hands coming thru the building and electronic videos behind it so that it looks like he's peering in the window at you (great photo op to get into his hands coming thru the wall). There's even a video above you as you ride the elevator to the observation deck. When you are on the deck, you can see the city spread out far and wide. The lights were incredible. It's also straight out of the ""Sleepless in Seattle"" movie. The deck was pretty crowded even though we didn't have to wait in lines, but I can imagine that it is way more crowded and that you'd have to wait in multiple lines if you were to visit during the day.",5.0,4.6196
5180,Lifetime Memory,"We debated whether the experience was worth the money with our 11 and 13 year olds--it was a big dent in our budget. I thought about whether they would remember their visit in 5 years and I realized that going to the very top of the ESB would be something that they would NEVER forget, so that's how I rationalized spending the money. I'm so glad we did!! You feel like you're on top of the world; it's so peaceful. The views are stunning. You can even see the Statue of Liberty. The floor to ceiling glass on the 102nd floor is crystal clear and the staff is very friendly. We took our time to really drink in the views and never felt rushed. I know we'll all remember this visit forever!",5.0,4.9642

5183,If you want to see NYC,This is a cool thing to do. Make sure that you have the time it will take a couple of hours to reach the top due to the people that are there. I know that you can pay the extra to not wait in lines. It may be worth it since the lines move slowly at times. Once you reach the top its really something to see how big NYC really is.,5.0,4.569
5184,One of New York City Greatest Landmark,Purchased the tickets directly from the official Empire State building web site; very easy to get the right package to access the venues you want to see; able to by pass by the lines and directly walk-in to start our tour; My wife and I went to see the new 2nd floor museum; and wander the 82 & 102 Floor observation decks; beautiful day and spectacular views of the city; I truly love New York City.,5.0,4.8762
5185,Fantastic views north & south. Buy skip the queue,"Have been up a few times but my partner really wanted to go up. This led to a sense of doom setting in at the dreaded queues. With rain and cloud all weekend we arrived early on a clear Monday. The queues met us at the end of the block to reach the outside door. We decided to buy two express tickets. Around $40 each with tax. This saved us about 2 & a 1/2 hours in total, with limited time in the city we think it was absolutely worth it and would recommend for couples!",5.0,2.1562
5186,Perfect for a solo trip,"Was on business trip to NY and decided to visit on one of the evenings. Incredible views, great museum, helpful staff, well worth the money.",5.0,4.744
5187,Love this building,"Ok so the lifts / elevators only hold so many people, so there will be queues it’s inevitable. But it’s worth the wait, the view is spectacular and the 86 floor is open air and not behind glass so you can get some fantastic photographs. The 102nd floor has had floor to ceiling windows installed so once again the view is magnificent but if you want to capture a great photograph from this level you must know how to take pictures through glass as it’s quite reflective. The staff at the top, at least on the occasions that we have visited are all pleasant and friendly and happy to answer questions or point you in the direction of landmarks. Defiantly a must do attraction when you are in New York",5.0,4.981

Yes lots of changes have been made (I miss going through the lobby through the art decor interior but I must say lots of fascinating things to do while getting to the top. Lots of movies, interaction and of course King Kong.

Didn’t realize pass did not include 102nd floor viewing area. Asked at 86th floor if we could still get extra pass. Directed to kiosk and paid $20 each. Glad we did. Small glass enclosed area. Only let appropriate number up there at a time. Great views!! We found the staff plentiful and helpful. One visit was enough, but glad we went. Sure it would have been totally different if crazy busy.",5.0,4.7994
5191,Worth climbing the heights!,Remember watching so many movies which focused so much romance about the Empire State Building but thought it may be just a bit of a bygone by now. How wrong I was.

Lol! I thought I was going to pass out going up those a stairs, but I made it, and it was worth it! The most beautiful and breathtaking views! Loved it!😊",5.0,4.9612
5196,Super view from 102,"We were lucky to have a sunny clear day. We paid for the express tickets including the 102nd floor, but as we went at 8;30 in the morning on a weekday the express tickets were completely unnecessary.

The view was stunning and although I’ve been before i had never been up to the 102nd. That was quiet and warm as its all enclosed, though the open air floor (86) is also pretty warm due to all the outdoor heaters! Well worth thrip, go early and during the week to avoid queues.",5.0,4.9102

5198,Would Have LOVED to Make it to the Top Top,"I was here 32 years ago and went to the top top all within about one hour as that was all the time I had in a layover in NYC and this is where I chose to go. LAST WEEK was a completely different experience.

My daughter and I had 3 hours to take a view from the top observation deck before our afternoon musical we had tickets for. We arrived at the entrance at 11am. At 12:20pm...an hour and 20 minutes waiting in a very slow moving line, we FINALLY see the elevator to take us to the 80th floor.

We get to the 80th floor and we are still inside the building with windows looking out to the NYC skyline. We THEN had to wait in yet another undetermined length of line to get to the next set of elevators to take us up to the outside observation deck. It's now 12:45ish and now we are next in line for the elevator. We then start seeing another line forming in a different direction. The lineup for the DOWN elevators we had JUST came up on. Looking at the time and knowing our musical was in 75 minutes, we bail just as the elevator that would take us to this iconic view arrives for us. We then wait another 20 minutes to get down and out onto the street once again.

I was very disappointed with how the staff could not tell you how long you would be waiting. I think that would be REALLY helpful. I would suggest going to Rockefeller Center because we got up with no line, and there are 3 levels to view from (outside) and it was awesome.",2.0,4.5478000000000005
5199,As MAYER2016 says: OBLIGATORYÍ PROGRAM IN NEW YORK,"Of course, there are options to see New York from the sky: ROCKEFELLER, or even the ONEWORLD. But the SMPIRE STATE BULDING is an icon itself, so we have chosen this place.
Once you are ""over"" the queue you ""get on the rolling conveyor"" and move with the mess of people along the whole visit. Elevator here, elevator there - everything ""under control”, and performed very professional way. The nice view from the terraces is given (since 80 years unchanged). What has been added to this is the introduction of the history of construction (the building has been completed in about 1-year time!!!) and a nice explanation about the building. A ticket costs around 40 USD. Is this much for an obligatory program???...",4.0,4.5252

5205,Magic views from the sky,"You go there for the views! In my opinion the Empire State Building has 2 advantages: 1. you can see both sides of Manhattan, one to the One World Building and the other side to Central Park. 2. The 86th floor is outside and you can hear the noise of the street, and you can make pictures to 4 sides of Mahhattan in a much better position. You have a good view on the One World Building from the ferry to Staten Island, so for me the Empire State Building is the best choice.",5.0,4.8302

When we arrived I was so pleased that I had as the queues were massive all the way through the normal tour. We arrived and were greeted by Siobhan who took us round. We went to a load of places that the general tour doesn't go, like the vault in the basement which is amazing to see. What Siobhan doesn't know wasn't worth knowing. She told us about the building for 1.5 hours in a completely inspiring and engaging way. We went up in lifts that the public weren't supposed to use to keep us moving quickly and nipped in and out of doors to avoid further queues. I have no idea what the other VIP tour guides are like, but Siobhan was outstanding. Thank you.",5.0,4.9079999999999995

5220,Empire stateque,"The building it’s self is spectacular, the view at the top is the same, I cannot remember to much of the interior as I was only stood there for 4 hours in the queue ,my mind went numb, a shame really, but the queue was depressing, at every turn, you were told to enjoy, as if this queue hell was about to end , at each blocked of turn, if I was to do it again, I would be there when the doors open. Don’t be put off by my review, just plan your visit, as it can take up a lot of time on a short trip.",3.0,1.223
5221,Iconic location,We all enjoyed our trip up ESB very much. Interesting displays on way to elevator and great views out over the city. We paid extra to go up to the 102nd floor - views basically the same but did get a better view of Central Park and skipped the queue for the lift down which was a big plus!,4.0,4.7398

Brilliant visit.",4.0,4.8462
5224,"High, but the queues...","The Empire State Building is a must see in NYC. The way to the top is renewed, in which the 'ride' in a helicopter over the city, made realistic by moving chairs, has been sacrificed. the long lines to the elevator have become a museum in themselves, with mural movies, artefacts from various times, a King Kong part, and great photos. However, when it is crowded, which it always is, don't be surprised to stand in line for well over an hour... so, go early, and do it once and never again..",3.0,4.4914000000000005

Plus side....fabulous view!",1.0,1.5336
5228,Beautiful view of the city!,"We had an hour to waste before another tour began so we decided to do a quick trip to the Empire State Building and it did not disappoint. It was a Friday afternoon around 11am and we got right in and the way they have it set up is you can go at your own pace and read about the history of the building or you can by pass and go straight to the elevator line which we appreciated since we were on a bit of a time crunch. We had beautiful views of the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island as well as Harold Square where the Macy’s Thanksgiving Parade makes a stop. It was a great way to spend an hour.",5.0,4.8856

My husband was very pleased to be the only person up on the viewing deck... not many people can say that! The security staff here were lovely and friendly,although I think they though we were a bit strange going out to the viewing deck in the wind and rain. We couldn’t see a thing but can still say we went to the top of the Empire State Building!",5.0,4.6564
5234,Iconic building,This was my third visit to the Empire State Building in 17 years. I never tire of the view as the skyline evolves over time. The 360 degree view is fantastic from both the 86th and 102nd floor. We turned up in mid afternoon on a sunny day and we didn’t have to queue to go up. It gets a little big crowded on the top but with patience you always find a way to see around the city with nobody in front of you. The exhibits are interesting as you learn about the construction of the building.,5.0,4.5984
5235,Family vacation,Express was amazing. Skipped all lines and priority for all the elevators. We were a large 11 people and 4 kids under the age of 9 and express made this visit smooth and special.,5.0,4.5158000000000005
5236,An experience of a lifetime,"You would expect some queuing for a world famous destination such as this and although it took around 45 minutes to get to the top, the wait was cleverly managed with exhibitions and events( watch out for King Kong!!!) which made the time go quickly. Very good security with airport style screening was appropriate and very welcome. Fun ceiling mounted video in the lifts which whisk you up 80 floors quickly and quietly and when you get to the top - wow! Truly what must be the most impressive view in the world. Go.

We went to the Intrepid thereafter and that was more “bang for your buck.” I guess at the end of the day the the prices are fair and justified? No matter, was a nice visit, but expensive for us.",3.0,4.852
5244,Best day,I visited with my sister and my mum. We found there was so much see as you walk around making your way to the top. The views from the 86th floor are amazing we paid the extra $20 and went up to the 102 floor which was offered even more amazing views. This place is a must to visit in New York.,5.0,4.711
5245,Very basic displays,"Overall, the visit was good. I was somewhat disappointed by the displays in the ""museum"" area.

They have much better exhibits including how the Empire State Building was built, but still insufficient elevators to the observation deck. In fact at one point the elevators could not handle the number of tourists -there was a 20 min wait to get to the observation deck so we walked 7 flights, Would I go back? Only if I am asked to take a group of family or relatives. It's not a very enjoyable experience getting to the top even though they got rid of ticket windows.",3.0,2.6852

It was so much more than an observation deck, it offered neat exhibits with fun picture opportunities. On top of that, the staff does an excellent job at keeping things running smoothly. We did go fairly early, so that may of helped in avoiding long lines and wait times. We did both the Empire State Building and the Top of the Rock observation deck, and we recommend the Empire State Building, hands down!",5.0,4.9738

We were in the queue to go through security at 9.15am. By the time we got to the top and spent 10 mins taking pics and left, it was 11.30am. I would suggest getting there just as it opens.

5257,Fogged in with no warning,I enjoyed the visit but the building was socked in with fog or clouds. I think maybe the staff selling tickets should have said that there would be no view from the top. We could not even see the top of the tower from the observation deck. I saw we had clouds but a reminder that the top had no view currently would have changed my mind and I would have come back tomorrow.,2.0,3.5692
5258,VIP process,We purchased vip and once you made it through the section where you head up elevators the signage broke down. We we shuffled through with general ticket holders for a 45 min very disorderly route to elevator. No format for lines so experience was people trying to get one person ahead to go nowhere. Once we made it through just before elevator my husband saw off to the side “red carpet” he and I and several other vip went over red rope to finally escape the chaos. Once to higher floor signage and ropes were very confusing. People cutting through side ropes to get to floor 102 elevator was exhausting. We didn’t stay long after vip frustration set in. However the view was spectacular and the story of very small duration of time it took them to build Empire was unbelievable. We have checked off the box and won’t be doing again. Left Disappointed with the process of offering a very expensive vip pass without vip service “ throughout”.,4.0,2.8166
5259,Shambolic queue/line management,"The view from the 102nd Floor is outstanding. Despite having bought tickets beforehand it took us 1hr15mins to get there.

I would reccommend to also take the night ticket. It is a complete new experience when you are there by night.",5.0,4.4514
5262,Amazing yet again,This is the second time I've been here. The improvement with the museum displays is fantastic. The history is great and interactive. We did the day and night ticket. The quietness at night was great as we got to look at things we didn't get chance to look at during the day due to how busy it was. Would recommend doing this experience as the changing views are fab.,5.0,4.923

5265,Bad weather condition - no one stopped people visiting and buying tickets,"I visited the Empire State Building on Tuesday 22nd October 2019 - booked the tickets in advance on the website. The weather on the day was miserable, but I was expecting to see something - on the top of the building the weather was completely different - dense fog all around the building. I couldn’t see a single thing!
I was shocked by the fact they were still selling tickets on the day and they let me in without mentioning the fact that my ticket was valid for 1 year and that I could have visited when the weather condition was going to be better!
I know that Empire State Building doesn’t refund tickets for weather issues, but when I asked if something could have been done to let me have another visit using the same ticket, the answer was that I should have known the ticket was valid for 1 year and seeing the fog I should not have gone up at all! This is a joke! My first time in New York and first time at the iconic Empire State Building was totally ruined that day!
They could have done more, for example by suggesting me not to visit at all on that day and use the ticket for another day during my vacation!",1.0,2.0978

5272,A must,I have been to the top of the empire state building twice now in the two visits I have been to NYC. I would say that if u are in the city you have to go to the top. On the way up you learn a lot of interesting facts about the building and see great pictures and videos of it being built. I got entry with my new York City pass both times. I would say it is best to visit the empire state building at night and go to the rocket feller during the day so u get good views of the empire state building during the day,5.0,4.9

I had to check in my tiny Swiss army knife with security, and then I lost my ticket. I like that knife. They couldn’t, of course, give it to me without the receipt, but the following day I found the receipt and I got it back. ESB Security were absolutely lovely in the way they handled the matter. No matter what people say, Newyorkers aren’t rude, quite the opposite. Thank you!",5.0,4.788
5280,Nice view of the city,"The night view is beautiful and the elevator ride was pretty fun!! I can say I’ve been there and don’t think I would go again. Paying to skip the line may be worth it but once up top same crowds. And waiting in an unorganized line for well over an hour or so is no fun especially when people try to skip. So once up top, we made the circle, took pictures, and left. No line to get out 🙂",3.0,4.809
5281,VISITING THE NEWLY RENOVATED EMPIRE STATE BUILDING NYC,"There’s never been a better time to share the historic Empire State Building (ESB) with your family. Soaring 1,454 feet above Midtown Manhattan, the ESB is New York City’s most recognizable and celebrated attraction. Thanks to a new top-to-bottom redesign, this should be on the top of your list for “must-see” experiences in NYC. Here's why you should make visiting the newly renovated Empire State Building in NYC on the top of your list.

This month, ESB revealed the newly renovated 102nd floor Observatory with 360-degree views of the city. Perched 1,250 feet above street level, the new Observatory features floor-to-ceiling glass windows, so your family can step right to the edge of the World’s Most Famous Building in the heart of New York City. The redesigned 102nd floor Observatory was Phase Three in a four phase, $165MM renovation project.

I've been up in a lot of tall buildings and can attest that the ESB is breathtaking. Made up of 24 crystal-clear, eight-foot-tall windows, the 102nd floor is an enclosed, climate- controlled, all-weather Observation Deck. Unlike One World Observatory, you'll get better views of Central Park and the northern parts of the city. The new viewing area allows guests to get 360-degree views of the city and beyond from the heart of New York City.

The experience starts on the 2nd floor of the ESB. Remember when waiting for an elevator used to be boring? Get ready to be dazzled, with this iconic NYC experience when you enter the brand-new Observatory entrance at 20 West 34th Street. They’ve turned the second floor into a 10,000 sq. ft gallery that brings guests on a journey from the building’s construction to its current place in pop culture.

ESB invested in bringing history alive through technology and gorgeous curation. From entrance to exit, guests will be surprised and delighted. Named the most Instagrammed U.S. landmark in a study conducted by Sony Mobile, the new galleries feature immersive and interactive exhibits that are prefect for families.

I loved seeing the workers simulate what it was like to build up on top of the world. The iconic photos were stunning and the hand's on learning stations make the line to the top fly by. It's all designed to keep guests captivated as they make their way to the one-of-a-kind views from the 86th Floor Observatory.

The new 2nd floor experience will take you back in time to the New York City streets of the late 1920s. Through video and interactive displays your family will get swept up in the excitement of “Opening Day”

Don’t miss the instagrammable shot of King Kong and I also loved seeing all the celebrities that have made a visit to the ESB part of the NYC red carpet experience.",5.0,4.9846

5283,The Building for excellent,It was more than I expected. The staff very helpfull and nice. An unique experience. In my opinion the building for excelence,5.0,3.9406
5284,Excellent experience with the VIP tour!!!,"Had a great tour of Empire State Building. Our tour was a little before dusk about an hour before sunset so we could watch the sunset over the harbor and see the lights come on across the city. It was incredible!!!
Our VIP tour had red carpets to guide our way, no waiting, and the staff was incredible helpful and friendly! We felt like movie stars the way we were treated along the way. The views outside on the observation deck were incredible but as anticipated, very crowded. However, if your patient, you can have plenty of opportunity to have unobstructed views looking out over the city on every side as people move around from each side of the deck. The lights coming on over the city were like so many stars twinkling here and there until it was all lit up and beautiful. Inside, the elevators were awesome and traveled approximately a floor per second! There’s a really cool museum at the start of the tour that has many interactive displays and photo ops. Over all, a trip to NY City just isn’t complete without a tour of the Empire State Building!!! We loved it!!!",5.0,4.9798
5285,Mind blowing on all levels,"Beautiful building, well run for visitors. Still could see the glamour of the era especially when exiting.
Can unite believe it was build so quickly, and all the photos if the workforce was great.",4.0,4.852

5288,Fabulous !,Well worth a visit . Well organised so there wasn’t much hanging around and there was no rush at all . We enjoyed the whole experience and the views are spectacular. A must attraction in NYC .,5.0,4.6962
5289,Stunning Views of NY,"We heeded all the advice and went early so queues were minimal, though the observatory was still packed out.
There is a lot of information about the original building and more recent renovation work which is all very well presented and interesting with some spectacular videos.
I expected the views to be good but I was impressed much more than expected - I could have stopped up there much longer and taken many more photos but we had given ourselves a schedule to keep to - learn from our mistake and give yourself longer than you think you'll need!
Most worthwhile - one of the 'musts' of trip to NY.",5.0,4.6522
5290,Must visit,"We loved our visit to this elegant and beautiful building. Every inch was beautiful. It was like stepping back in time to a golden era. We had a five year old with us and she loved king kongs hand and the elevator roof video. Then....the view, simply breathtaking.",5.0,4.9632000000000005
5291,Fantastic moment!,An amazing attraction! By day or by Night the view from the top of Empire is amazing! My husband and i spent a fantastic moment,5.0,4.8968
5292,Toured Empire State Building,We picked up our tickets from the Big Bus tour on a Saturday. We did the Empire State Building 1st thing on a Sunday morning. The weather was supposed to turn bad that afternoon so we were in a hurry. We went through the downstairs exhibits very fast. You could probably spend and hour or two there if you had the time. It was not crowded at the time we went but looking at the way the tour was set up it looks like this could get very crowded. The views from the observatory were just unbelievable. I would certainly recommend seeing the Empire State Building.,5.0,4.7216000000000005
5293,Awesome,"Awesome. Staff was kind. When I used the kiosk to purchase ticket, the receipt printed first and I took that thinking it was the ticket. Only when I got to the entrance I was told that it was the receipt and not the ticket. Fortunately, I spoke to the lady behind the ticket counter, and she was able to give me the code for my original ticket and I was able to get in without paying for it again. Maybe the ticket needs to be on 1 stub so this is avoided.",5.0,4.5968
5294,visit of Empire,"perfect visit, very well organized. Employees very competent, very nice. Amazing view
Superb experience",5.0,4.9298
5295,Review,"It's not really anything to do with the attraction itself - it's just the amount of people, which isn't the attraction''s fault or the visitor's fault - it's just harder to enjoy than I thought it would be",3.0,4.7326
5296,Not worth the queue,This experience could have been better if the queues were more organised and if they gave you an estimated wait time upon arrival. A lot of people also seemed to be having trouble buying tickets at the automated machines and there weren’t enough staff available to help with that. The building sells itself because it is so iconic and it is amazing when you get to the top but even then it is so crowded. I wouldn’t advise people to do this activity unless it was really a bucket list item as you can climb some of the other skyscrapers much easier and get similar views,3.0,4.6302
5297,Spectacular!!!!!,Highly recommended!!!The view was breathtaking especially at night. You can not leave NYC not doing it!!!,5.0,4.3008
5298,Amazing,Nice views and wonderful building I am enjoined so much with my friend. The best time to visit in sunsets 🌅 because you can see everything in the evening and also at night.,5.0,4.8626000000000005
5299,Scape to NYC,"This beautiful Landmark is one of the best to visit in NYC! It’s the heart of our city, but after the renovated Observatory Deck! I will said that is something you don’t wanted missed. It’s amazing sunrise or sunset! The view is just amazing, breathtaking and beautiful!",5.0,4.9568
5300,Amazing Empire State!,"Our visit was fantastic and It was a verte good oportunitie to know the story of this building, awesone!!",5.0,4.591
5301,Amazing!,Visiting the Empire State Building is a must whilst in New York. I visited at night time and the view from the top was absolutely timeless. The lights were stunning and so pretty. A jaw dropping experience that I will never forget.,5.0,4.641
5302,"New 102nd floor nice, nighttime selfies not so much",The newly redesigned 102nd floor observatory is really nice. Great views of NYC. The 86th floor outdoor observation deck has also been changed a bit. Once thing in particular we noticed was the addition of heating lamps up above the outdoor deck to keep things from getting too chilly. Anyone wanting to take an outdoor nighttime selfie with NYC in the background will experience an unfortunate side effect of an orange hue come from the light of the heating lamps. Unless to make the photo black and white both you and anyone else in the photo will come out looking orange. Other than that the new experience is pretty nice.,4.0,4.7898
5303,Trapped in the lift for 30 minutes with terrified fellow visitors and nothing but poor attitude from staff,"It took over 30 minutes to get to the viewing platfrom while having to climb several fights of stairs to get to the top. It was chaotic and disorganised to say the least compared to Top of the Rock and One World Trade center. On the way down our lift got stuck and the light began to flicker. There were 17 of us in the lift, some old, some claustophobic, some angry, some scared. We buzzed the alarm and the member of staff on the other side was rude, unprofessional, inconsiderate and inappropriate. He did nothing to calm the visitors or manage the situation. We had signal in the lift. Some people were tweeting, messaging and calling family. This was very much ecause of the treatment we were receiving. Once the lift doors opened a senior manager apologised to us and refunded us. He was professional, courteous and considerate. Not everyone was happy but I was happy that he had shown some respect. I'd like to come again at some point but a tip for the senior managers is that you really should train your junior staff on situation management. People pay good money for an 'experience'. You need to ensure your staff are on message",1.0,3.1662
5304,Great visit!!,We went there in 2006 and now in 2019 again. And we saw a lot of good changes. We had a great time. Thanks!,5.0,4.761
5305,wonderful on a sunny day,"Having got there early, we decided to get tickets and go up as there was no queue and the weather was perfect. Hard to plan for good visibility so we were lucky and were rewarded with the perfect views of NYC all around.",5.0,4.8642
5306,Empire State Building Tour,"Very impressive. Despite the large number of tour participants, lines moved well. Obviously, these people have done this before....!",5.0,4.3936

5308,Go early!!!,"Go early in the morning and see NY before the crowds show up. After 9 am the views are still tunning, but taking a picture without someone in it is hard.",5.0,2.6938

Extraordinary experience and spectacular view both day and night.
Very professional and friendly staff. We'll be back",5.0,4.0733999999999995

Interesting exhibits about the constructions.",4.0,4.6924
5318,"Beatiful view, but very touristy","The view is beautiful day and night. Loved the saxofoon player in the nighttime! Didn't love the long way to eventually come to the floor with the view, liked the king kong feature, but especially didn' t like the stairs from the 79th up to the 86th.",4.0,4.6426

i would go there again if it will be possible.. I will see ..

5321,New York holiday trip,We visited New York early in the morning and we really enjoyed it all. We got a great view from both observatories and it wasn’t too busy. I would highly recommend!,5.0,4.7904
5322,Amazing,We went at sunset and it was just phenomenal the view was amazing! There was massive queues but staff worked quickly,5.0,3.8006
5323,Hot head.,Fast track ticket was very effective but queues were short so not really best value with hindsight. View was everything I expected and more. Heaters overhead on viewing platform were a bit hot. Top of my head felt scorched and it was not very cold just very windy. A must do NY trip.,5.0,1.6108
5324,Ascent was long but distracted by interesting displays. Descent was just long,"I’ve been up the ESB many times over the years and usually off season. This time we arrived about 10am on a sunny weekday in mid October. The queue was snaking out the door already but there were interesting and interactive displays for all ages most of the way up. Both visual and written.
By the time the lift got us to 79th floor they were offering the emergency stairs as an alternative means to access the 86th floor. We took the stairs instead of standing in another queue - this time without distractions.
View was fabulous - perfect sunny day without any wind but despite that the patio heaters were all on and were so fierce that I had to put my hand over my scalp to stop the intense heat hurting the top of my head!! Great touch for a chilly day but...
The viewfinders were free which was a nice touch and great to locate various landmarks
Sadly the experience was let down by the long queues down
Note that the Top of the Rock gives much better and full views of Central Park but it’s not as iconic as the ESB",4.0,4.984
5325,Improvement,"Great way improvement compared to 13 years ago. Wanted to skip it because I have seen it then. But because of some extra time we decided to visit it anyway, and glad we did. They made a museum inside the building wich was beautiful and interactive. We didn’t had a queue so could walk all the way trough.",5.0,4.8626000000000005
5326,Amazing history with great views,"Worth a visit to appreciate the history and engineering accomplishment. Brilliant views of Manhattan, howling wind, real sense of the height. Fairly comfortable queuing and moved at a decent speed. Great to see all the famous visitors over the years, even King Kong got a room to himself, great photo opportunity. Only con was the official photograph, reasonably priced compared to other famous landmarks we have visited but once home and logged on the end result was very poor. I wouldn’t bother buying if I were you.",4.0,3.8294

5334,Excelente view of Manhattan,"About all observations we visited, it was the best, You feel the wind and the Best and real view of Manhattan",5.0,4.711
5335,Sadly- couldn’t see a thing!,We booked our tickets before our trip so had to go on a certain day. There was no queue but even if there had been these tickets would not have got us into a priority queue. The day we had to go was the only overcast and drizzly day of our trip so we were unlucky. I would recommend not bothering to buy tickets in advance if you are keen to see the views. The queues are likely to be much longer on a clear day but if the pre-booked tickets don’t get you in any quicker there’s no point really. We enjoyed the indoor displays about the building of the Empire State and are pleased to be able to say we had been. The actual buildings of the New York City library and Grand Central station are much more impressive... and free!,3.0,4.9658
5336,"Friendly, Energetic staff, and great views!","Our group of 4 arrived around 4:30p on a Saturday. We were able to purchase tickets and take in the views on the 86th floor in roughly 1 hour time. For this time of the day, the staff was very friendly, often joking with each group.",5.0,4.373

5340,To much confusion!,"We were very excited to visit the 102nd story of the Empire State Building and thought we had purchased the proper ticket online. Nope! So, ok our fault for not noticing the fine print. However, we were willing to purchase a ticket but the kiosk on the observatory deck, 86th floor was not working. Sadly we had to walk away without getting to the top. Staff were fabulous and so were the views.",3.0,4.689
5341,Amazing experience,"I really loved the experience of climbing the Empire State Building, since ground floor with the history of the building, the construction facts, the room with King Kong i loved it! The films featuring the Empire State, the experience inside the elevator, and finallly the great view of NYC is really really great, and the binoculars to view trough them! Thanks Empire State for the experience!
PD. I also loved my free Empire State bag souvenir for taking the survey at the exit. I hope to back soon!",5.0,4.9724
5342,My childhood dream location,"When i visited it was very windy and view from 86th floor open area and it was very scarry and thrilling experience.
The wind was so powerful that if any tornado like upward airthrust occurs it may throw small children out,though it sounds like a fiction.hence if the top is also fenced,it would be much safer",5.0,4.8782

5371,Still a contender,"Even though ESB isn't the world's tallest building anymore, it still was fun to go up and see the city skyline from its top at night. The entrance wasn't as easy as you'd think to get to if you've never been to the city and your Uber driver dropped you off on the wrong block. But I found it eventually and made my way up. There wasn't a huge line to deal with especially since I booked my ticket months ago. The little museum displays were nice and gave an adequate history of the building's construction. I did appreciate the heated awnings on the observation deck! It was dark, cold and rainy when I went up so they came in super handy!",4.0,4.8196
5372,A must visit,"Before going up to the top, you pass through a display explaining how and why the building had been built.

The 1st lift to the top, takes you up to floor 80 and then you change to another lift, to go to the top.

Wow....what a view from the top. I'm so glad I went up.",5.0,4.6346
5373,Amazing views,"This is the second time I’ve gone up the Empire State Building and I wasn’t left disappointed. The views are outstanding!

The organisation of the queues isn’t anywhere as organised as the Rockefeller, it’s a bit of a free for all when you get inside after buying your tickets.

As you queue up you proceed through the history of the building which is good, although it’s a stretch to call it a museum!

We bought tickets for the 102nd floor which gives you great views and isn’t as busy as the 86th floor! The 102nd floor has glass floor to ceiling windows but you can still get great photos! The 86th floor gives you amazing views, due to the metal railings around the floor it can be fun trying to get a photo and you will have fun feeling like you’re going to drop it your phone!

We turned up on the day to buy tickets and in total it took us over 2 hours.",5.0,4.9706

5377,Empire State Building - visit,"Only booked our tickets the day before. We walked to the Empire State Building early-ish and had a quick entry to the building.

Had a fantastic morning there !",5.0,4.8596

5379,Empire State Building,The evening we went it was very wet but we had booked our tickets so we went anyway. Due to the weather there were no queues so that was great. The view was compromised at times with cloud but when it swept away the view was spectacular and we thoroughly enjoyed our trip to the top of the building. The staff very so friendly and helpful and we would go back in a second,5.0,4.9478
5380,"Fun, but not the best","We had passes to the Empire State Building and Top of the Rock through CityPass. While ESB was fun, it's definitely not the best ""high"" view in NYC. Top of the Rock hands down wins, mainly because (1) you can see Central Park and the ESB from TOR and (2) there's just more room to roam around at TOR compared to ESB. Would still recommend doing both if it's your one and only visit to NYC. Seeing the inside of the ESB and the history as you go up is worth seeing at least once.",4.0,4.8136
5381,Great history museum and great view even on a rainy and stormy day!,"We went on a stormy day and I felt like I was going to be blown off the observation deck, but that turned out to be half the fun.

5384,Cool experience,"I hadn’t been here in years & bought tickets for the new observatory on the 102nd floor.

Obviously, this place is packed on a Friday night so the entire experience took about 3 hours. I’d definitely go again.",4.0,4.0512
5385,Good experience,Spectacular views of New York but very long lines until you take the elevator. It was more desperate if you go with children.,3.0,1.9498
5386,Breathtaking,This was a great tour. We got there when they opened and it was not to crowded. There were long lines by mid morning. We bought our tickets there but it would be better to buy on line and not have to jump out of line to buy them. There is a lot to see in the museum and it was not to crowded early morning. We were the only ones on the elevator to the 79th floor. There was only 4 on the elevator to the 86th floor. The Observation deck was more crowded but not bad. The views were magnificent. Be sure to dress appropriately because the October air was chilly and it was quite windy. This is a tour you don't want to miss.,5.0,4.9256
5387,Just great!!!,"Since I was a little kid I wanted to visit the Empite State Building. It is just great! Lots of information, the architecture is beautiful (in my opinion, one of the most beautiful skyscrapers), a perfect view of New York ...

She's been to NY before, so she also kina knew her way around. We did the AM/PM tour because she wanted to take in the night lights. The ticket system was a pain because it wasn't working right, so we got messed up there. The gentleman working the area took us straight to the ticket booth and they didn't bat an eye, made it right for us and we had fun. Taking it all in so high up, is breathtaking.

5390,Must visit atttraction when in New York.,"We arrived at the Empire State Building before 9.00 a.m. so we bought the standard tickets, not paying nearly double to skip the line. So glad we didn't waste our money as the queues were minimal through security and for the elevators. The information about the construction of the building was interesting and the views were great on a beautifully clear day. I had read it could be cold and windy at the top but there were heaters on the outside walls - quite unnecessary on a sunny day. It is easy to take photographs as there is no glass in the way. The only negative was having to wait to have your photograph taken before getting in the elvator when you know you are not going to buy it afterwards!",5.0,4.7936

All the staff were very friendly and pointed out where you needed to go etc. They even wished me a happy birthday on a few occasions!
The views are amazing from all 4 sides of the building and as there is no time limit you can spend as much time up there as you want.",5.0,4.718
5396,Renewed and exciting.,"The new Empire State building experience is far more interesting than used to be. My last visit was on late 2016 and compared with this year experience is soo different. the new experience is kids friendly, engaging and very interactive, far better than staying in a boring line after security.

I dind`t have the opportunity to visit the new 360 observatory but for sure I'll come back next year to appreciate the city from this new venue.",5.0,4.8472

There was a red carpet to follow which took us past lots of people starting right inside the street level door. It was a little tricky to scan the phone several times on our way up, but staff helped with that. We walked up the last seven flights of stairs but found out later there is an elevator to take. It was well worth the extra cost.",5.0,4.7097999999999995

We went up at 4 and had dinner reservations at the State Grille for 5p.m. Then we find out we could not go back up after dinner!

The elevator goes first to the 80th floor and from there i can recommend to walk the last six floors to the 86th, because it's much faster than with the elevator. The same goes for the way back. The only is that you cannot see the ESB!;) For that you have to go to 'Top of the Rock' or 'One world observatory'. But the views where amazing! So highly recommended!",5.0,4.8608

I don’t know if it’s what she said or her tone but Guthren is a special lady!

5457,An iconic visit,The empire state building was as beautiful as ever with breath taking views from the very top. Glad we visited during the week because it was in and out with no need to add express pass to the already pricey tickets. Definitely feel it was worth the extra to pay to go to the 102nd floor. We were able to get great pictures without the strong cold winds NYC was experiencing on this day. The museum was an added bonus since they did not have this when I was a kid.

It was breathless",5.0,4.728
5465,Needs improvement,"The view and building are beautiful of course but the lines they form to lead people through are confusing and chaotic! Even one of the workers joked it was chaos. Also we excitedly traveled across the county to take our children and were once again disappointed this time with the management. The first time we went we were told it was to foggy and there was zero visibility so we should hold on to our tickets and come back anytime at a later date and they would honor them. So here we are this year excited to finally make it make to NYC and upon arrival to the Empire State Building with our tickets the manager told us we couldn’t use our tickets from before since we had no proof that we were told we could use them past the expiration date. We traveled so far so obviously we said ok and purchased another set of 4 tickets after he refused to honor any of the first set of 5. He told us if we had a written note or remembered the persons name we spoke to maybe he could do something... it was terrible customer service. I hope they improve their policy and the way they have their staff handle situations like ours not making it seem as though all they care about is money money money. This didn’t stop us from smiling anyway taking our pictures, taking the tour to the 102 floor which costs extra FYI or from spending about $150+ in the gift shop since we are not sure we will go back after that experience",3.0,4.938
5466,Very enjoyable,Didn't know what to expect but lived up to my expectations the views were unbelievable and the history behind it was very interesting there are free viewing machines that you can see for miles so good,4.0,4.8994

5468,GO DURING NIGHT TIME!,"Of course NY is always great but the views from the Empire at the night time is another thing, the only thing ... is a little bit windy",5.0,3.7432
5469,Still a must do,Came with teenagers who have never been to NY before and they loved it. Still worth it . Takes a few minutes to get up there with the volume of people and was busy at the top but you still have the opportunity to get loads of great photos. Heaters outside at the top to keep you warm too.,5.0,4.9062

5471,Sunday morning,I visited it Sunday morning. Short queue. Friendly staff. Sunshine and nice panorama views. The platform at 86 floor is open.,5.0,4.53
5472,A view of the lights to remember,"As a tourist in New York, the Empire State building will definitely be on your bucket list. Here is a little tip to make your visit more memorable and romantic. Visit the Empire State building at midnight and head to the top for a view of the city lit up as far as the eye can see. Night admission is open up to 2 AM and NO QUEUES!!!!",5.0,4.3812
5473,Great View!,It was great to go up to the observation deck of the Empire State Building. I was there in 1980 and I noticed a number of improvements made. The floor where you change elevators has some interesting things to see. The elevator movie is quite amazing. The employees were friendly and helpful. The view was spectacular and we stayed till the sun went down and watched the city lights come on. Great value!,5.0,4.9566
5474,Excellent!,The experience was amazing! Well organized entrance! The view from New York is surreal! City pass gives you one entrance during day and one coming back at the same night! We loved to see both!,5.0,4.7988

5480,Just awesome,"What a wonderful experience.
Recommend to every one who visit NYC
The Open roof top at night was the high light for me an my family.",5.0,4.5812
5481,Expensive & chaotic but has to be done.,"I first went up the ESB in 1981 when you turned up, called the lift, paid a couple of dollars and had plenty of room on the Ob Deck. I went again in 1990 and don’t remember it being any different to 1981. In 2019, it was a whole new experience. Airport style security, approx $50 for a standard ticket (express is over $70), a pre-elevator museum and chaotic queues. The staff are friendly and engaging but the system is not fit for purpose and it wasn’t that busy. Queues, express queues, queues for going up, down, the stairs ... all merging together and causing carnage. But, it’s the ESB, the views are spectacular and it has to be done. Allow half a day, most of which will be spent queuing.",3.0,3.5396

But it was too crowded to fully appreciate it. Better view and less people at the TOR",4.0,4.8082

5487,Birthday Celebrations,"This was my first visit to NY and the Empire State Building and it did not disappoint, it is very well controlled for the amount of people who come through the doors, the visit is interesting from start to finish, well done to everyone who makes this so enjoyable...I can't wait to visit again!",5.0,4.6832
5488,Typical tourist attraction,"We we were fortunate to visit in October during the off-season. All we kept hearing is how terrible the lines are in the summer. If we did have to wait in long lines, this attraction would not have been worth it. The observatory on the 86th floor is the highlight. It's nice that they tell you which direction you are facing so you can look for landmarks. But unless you're going to spend a lot of time up there, there isn't much else to do. The exhibits were typical museum-type offerings - photos with explanations of what you're seeing. It would have been better if we had signed up for a guided tour but they were too expensive. The King Kong room was clever, but again, it wasn't someplace you would spend a lot of time in. I would say you could do either the Empire State Building or the Top of the Rock, but I wouldn't bother doing both.",3.0,4.8868
5489,Amazing views.,It was hard to believe this skyscraper was built in the 1920's considering its 80 something floors high. The views from the top were amazing and at the bottom of the skyscraper it tells the story of how they were built which was fascinating. Its definitely a must see if your visiting NYC.,5.0,4.772
5490,Wow! Iconic NYC tower,"You can't go to NYC without visiting the Empire State building. I won't repeat what others have said but a couple of tips are that it's included in the Citypass and you avoid the ticket line. Be prepared to queue to get to the top, and dress warmly because it's windy up there",4.0,4.2972
5491,Magical,Fantastique. A sunset on the top of the empire stade building is magical ! Impossible to visit New-York without going up.,5.0,3.5427999999999997
5492,Empire State Building,A must visit. Make sure you have plenty of time as you will stand in a few lines. But with that said they seemed to handle the lines very well . Also make sure to spend the little extra money and see it from the very top .WOW what a wonderful view,5.0,4.9446
5493,Empire State Building NYC,"Excellent visit, even though it was really busy. I went up at night and the views are spectacular. There are also some very good exhibits about the history of the building.

I highly recommend you buy the skip-the-lines ticket, if money is no object. The lines for regular tickets were getting close to an hour long (both up and down) but my ticket got me on the elevators right away. The staff were very good at getting me past the crowds.",5.0,4.683
5494,Not informed of extra cost,"Fantastic view well organised
New floor was poorly advertised and very expensive considering there were 3 of us",4.0,4.3816
5495,Sunday in NYC,Empire State Building was great. It was definitely a plus to go between 3 and 5 pm in the afternoon. The lines were not as long and they moved quickly. The reason this was not a perfect visit was that we ended up standing in the wrong line to go down. We almost missed our dinner reservation because of this mistake. They should have someone pointing you to the exit because with a lot of people signage doesn't work because you can't see it. The views were spectacular. Well worth it.,4.0,3.0232
5496,Breathtaking,"Defo avoid peak times, we went first thing and queues were great, but heard sometimes you can be there a while just like anything if we all go at once.",5.0,4.2738
5497,Amazing views from midtown Manhattan,Visited the 86th and 102nd floors. Worth going just to see the view from the top of midtown. Costed about $63.15 USD. The base floor has you travel through a museum on your way to the elevator to the top. I liked the homage to the various media that have paid tribute to the empire state building (recent games like Spider man PS4 are featured in tribute and poster frames as well).,5.0,4.6632
5498,Worth it!,This was our first time in New York and we really appreciated our visit to the Empire State Building. The view is breathtaking and the exhibits are very interesting for the whole family.,5.0,4.724
5499,Fun afternoon and great views,"We enjoyed our time here. There is a nice museum in the way to the elevators. It is more of a series of full wall videos on what it would have look building it and probably to keep you entertained if/when the line is really long. You stop on the 79th floor with more photos and placards of the building of the building. Then there are 7 flights of stairs to the 86th floor, the outside observatory. There are places to stop and catch your breath (which some people did). Beautiful views up top! A fun way to spend a few hou5in NYC. Tip: if it is busy, get the express ticket or you will be in line forever!",5.0,4.8508

5502,What’s not to love? Fabulous,Second time at the Empire State Building love this building and the views you get it’s a great feeling to be up one of the most famous buildings in New York. This time I was able to go up to the new observation area in the tower on the 102nd floor and it didn’t disappoint was just wow 😍,5.0,4.7958

5511,Excellent experience,"Really liked visiting this iconic architectural building.
There was really small amount of people and it took me 20 minutes for entry the elevators what is really quickly for this place.
We reached floor 79, made photo and took a small tour in museum of the building.
Then we took elevator to 80th floor and moved to the viewpoint when you can see stunning panorama of the city and can see through the binoculars for closer look and when you comes back to the ground floor you are getting your photo for remembrance.
For sure will comeback there and can recommend to everyone.",5.0,4.7436

5522,Wildly High!,"As we stepped out onto the top of the building, the wind whipped our hair wildly! It was an exhilarating introduction to being so high up. Walking around the edge of the building gave unparalleled views of the city and across to the Statue of Liberty. It looked like a little model village. Although there were barriers (obviously) to keep us safe, photographs were easily taken - just hang on to your phone in the wind! The experience on the way up involved some history of the building as well as King Kong. Be prepared for a bit of a wait at the lifts (maybe 15 minutes) or take the stairs!",5.0,4.9114

5525,Stunning view,"The most wonderful clear view of the city, beautiful building itself and interesting info all round, perfect place to visit",5.0,4.9058
5526,Not great!,We queued to get up for almost 2 hours and to come down for about an hour but were only at the top of the building for a total of 10 minuets. Staff were really rude and unhelpful. Especially the guards outside who were supposed to guid you in and explain where you need to go. They were down our throats every time we tried to ask a question and just were not interested in helping. This may be normal if you’re a local but as a tourist it was not a nice experience at all. Won’t visit again.,1.0,1.2252

5538,Highlight of my New York Trip!,"My family and I visited the ESB in October ’19 at around 18:30, right at sunset. Excellent view in all directions at Manhattan, Hudson and East River. Espacially the transistion between the fading sunlight and the step-by-step enlighted buildings was awsome to experience! The organisation on the observation deck could be better. There is no limit for the number of people and sometimes it‘s hard to find space in the first row.
Beside that, I highly recommend to visit the observation deck. The Panorama view espacially in the direction of lower Manhattan is priceless!",5.0,4.5126
5539,Awesome experience!,"Visiting the ESB was awesome! The price was fair to reach the 80th floor...I was too scared to take the glass elevator to the 102nd, but highly recommend it. The building has been meticulously kept up, and the modern improvements maintain the Art Deco. The staff was very friendly and the other guests were also. Everyone took their time, not pushy, and allowed all to enjoy the building and view of NY. Would go back again...this time to get to the 102nd floor.",5.0,4.9322

5545,Not enough organization,Not enough direction from the staff. We enjoyed the trip to the Empire State Building but when it was time to go to the next floor level there was no one telling anyone where to go. Lines going up and going down we’re mixed together. People coming inside from outside were jumping into line instead of being directed which line to get into. Loved the views but needs more organization.,4.0,4.3816

5547,102nd floor is worth the visit in the dark,"We visited the 86th floor in the morning and had a glorious clear day and could see for miles. We got some great pictures and memories.
As someone who is generally a little afraid of heights, the 86th floor is surrounded by brickwork and a steel fence so I felt pretty secure to look down and get some photos.
Our tickets allowed a second visit in the same day so we opted to go after sunset...We realised that the 102nd floor had opened the previous day after refit and decided to upgrade the tickets at the desk on the second floor. It was just over $40 USD total for both of us to upgrade.
The views from 102 are something else.....it is glass, floor to ceiling which had my legs tingling a bit at times...The photos are spectacular and will be with us forever.",5.0,4.904

I would recommend it to anyone who wants to have an unforgettable memory about NY 🏙❤️ I was lucky enough to see the sun go down up there, and It was truly amazing 🙂 It’s definitely worth the money 👌🏻",5.0,4.9344
5569,"Beautiful, but got suckered","So first the good: This is a wonderful way to visit the Empire State Building. If you can afford it, it is definitely worth the cash. There were about 50 of us and it felt private and was much more enjoyable than it would have been in a larger crowd. The issue I have is that they sold us a package- this Sunrise experience plus two breakfasts at the StateGrill, knowing full well that it isn't open on the weekends! The security staff said it happens every single weekend. It feels shady and was irritating. They knew when I made my reservation it was for a Saturday, but offered us this option anyhow - with no disclaimers about the hours of the State Grill. Super frustrating and I want my money back for the breakfast that I was not able to enjoy ($25 each is nothing to sneeze at!). I have emailed them and am awaiting a response. Will update if by some miracle they do the right thing and refund it. So, beware- don't book the package if you are going on a weekend!",3.0,4.7942

5571,Crowded but good,"Buy tickets ahead of time online, the lines seem to keep moving, but be prepared for crowds. It is windy/ colder at the top. it is worth it to take stairs where possible, lines for elevators are long. binocular machines at the top are free",4.0,4.8218
5572,awesome sunset,"i arrived about 5:30, went throu the museum and by the time i got to the top unset colors had started, i really liked staying from sunset to the moment when the city lits up",5.0,4.1968
5573,WAY TOO MANY PEOPLE,So disappointed. SO MANY PEOPLE. It cost us over $100 to go up. It's very organized but just to busy. Had to wait for a lookout spot and always felt crammed in,3.0,2.4096
5574,Wow views,We bought tickets prior to travel for the 86th floor but while we were there they had just finished the 102nd floor. The views are amazing from 86 but even better from 102. A great experience learning about the building. Very informative and entertaining. The most beautiful in the city.,5.0,4.9518
5575,NYC at Night,NY at night from the Top of the Empire State Building was fantastic. By chance we went up on the evening but so glad we did. Would definitely recommend the night viewing!,5.0,4.897
5576,Breathtaking,Iconic building. Breathtaking views. Love the lift ceiling videos. Had a fast pass so seamless entry.,5.0,4.604
5577,Beautiful as expected,"It is as beautiful as you would expect it to be. We visited on 15 Oct around 10 AM and had skip the line tickets which are a double the price of the normal tickets given the reviews of long waiting periods but frankly while going up, it was literally a 10 min difference max between the queues till the 79th floor. From 79th to 86th floor, the express tickets helped save at least 25 min for the next elevator. While coming down, the express tickets helped us quite a bit since the general queue was announced to be half hour waiting. A good thing they did to keep the queues moving was allow people to take stairs from 86th to 79th floor and join the elevators from there for crowd control probably.

If you are getting the express tickets, highlight express using a pen else it’s easy for them to miss and point you towards the general queue - happened with us and when I realised, I went back and was told we should have highlighted 🙄. We were not offered the wristbands of express which we saw some people wearing for easy identification so not sure where you’d get that from but stick to your ticket for sure, it gets scanned multiple times on the way up n down for express queue.

If you are ok to loop in an hour sorts of waiting times in queues, then go with the regular tickets and turn up early (more like 8 AM - 10 AM) and grab breakfast post facto to move faster.

Definitely a must do, if not for the Manhattan skyline then for the iconic movies we have grown up watching which have been shot here - heartbeat of NYC!",5.0,4.9662
5578,Fab Views,Loved my trip to NYC and could not believe how exciting it was to be on the 102 floor of the EBS. Fab wee tour and amazing views of the best city.,5.0,4.8454
5579,5 star if you go to 102,We had already done Top of the Rock and on our last day thought we would walk to the Empire State to have a look. We were surprised to find there were no real queues so decided to go up including the newly refurbished 102 level. The normal obsevatory levels are of course very good though you don't really notice the slight extra height on the Rock but the views are slightly different. The special bit however is going up to the very small platform at the 102 level with the new floor to ceiling glass. You are up in the circular tower on the top of the building and on the North side especially it feels like you are looking straight down 1200ft+ to street level. The views are great and you do feel the height.,5.0,4.9208
5580,Iconic Journey,"The visit to The Empire State completely depicts the evolution of New York City.
A must do.
We spent a significant amount of time at both platform views, the 102nd floor does add a bit more for those not wanting to go up that extra level you get a fantastic view from the 86th floor.
This is a must do trip at least once in your life.",5.0,4.3194
5581,A day to remember,"Since seeing the infamous film with Cary & Deborah, I have wanted to visit here for so long - it lived up to my expectations. Such an incredibly beautiful building with wonderful views, how can you not come here if you are in New York? It can get crowded but take your time and soak in the history of this amazing iconic building.",5.0,4.8082
5582,Beautiful historical building with great city views,"I loved visiting the Empire State Building. The interior is very nice and the staff are friendly, and your visit from beginning to end is well-organized. Prior to entering the observation deck, tourists are led through a room which explains the process of constructing the building and has very nice, large-screen animations of how the workers were constructing the building. There is also another cool room with a picture of King Kong's face and his giant plastic paws coming through the windows. It makes for a nice photo. I know that especially during the tourist high season everybody is probably rushing through these rooms so they can get to the observation deck, but I think both of these rooms are really cool and are worth your time to stop, look at the exhibits and take a couple of photos and/or videos. As far as the observation deck, there is an indoor section with windows, and an outdoor section that has a fence. I dont like the fence as it gets in the way of the photos. Also, when you have no walls or glass to shield you on the observation, be prepared for gale force winds and hold onto your hats and your cell phone tightly! I could not spend more that a couple of minutes there due to the wind. If you are worried about any wind up there, the top of the Rock I found had way less wind, due to the outdoor observation area being surrounded by glass. I visited both on the same day. Best to get to the Empire State Buidling 15 to 20 mins before it opens to secure a good spot in line, even if you already have tickets. Its included in most of NYC passes. If you get a city pass like we did, you can visit day and night on the same day, which is pretty cool. As far as the views, of course they are great. You get a better view of the downtown business district that from top of the Rock, at least in my oppinion, but not as good of a view of central park as from Top of the Rock. I highly recommend this viewpoint for all visitiors to NYC.It's the King Kong building after all! At the end of our tour, there is a souvenir shop that you can visit and the staff with take a souvenir photo of you which you may purchace if you like.",5.0,4.9862
5583,it was very good,i went at midnight the view was amazing just to see all the buildings light up at that time of night best experience ever only bad thing was it was cold and the heaters were on but they were very high up and couldn't feel anything. other than that it was a good experience.,4.0,4.53
5584,ANOTHER ICONIC BUILDING IN NEW YORK,"We visited the Empire State Building on our first full day in the city. It was my first visit to America though my friend had visited New York about four years ago. The Empire State Building was my choice of what I wanted to see first of all. We had purchased an atrraction pass back in the UK which meant we didn't have to queue to buy tickets though we had to queue to go through the security scanner etc. I liked the photo opportunities with backdrops of a model Empire State, the models of the workers who built it and then a model of King Kong. I was fascinated with the photos of celebrities who had been to the top of the building too.

Once at the top, accessed via a lift which went VERY fast indeed, we were afforded great views over the city. It was a beautiful day, sunny and clear, so everyone was out taking photos.

It was a lovely visit and something I will always remember for being such an iconic building.",5.0,4.9719999999999995

5587,Fabulous experience!,Wonderful job on the renovation. We were in town from Chicago and were fearful it would be too crowded.

5589,Go to the top,"Like all attractions there can be a big line up at the Empire State building but it is worth the wait. Be sure to pay the extra and go the the 102nd floor it is worth it.

5591,A dream come true.,"I went with my grandmother to New York from the 3rd to 7th of October. She had already visited it a lot of times, but this was my first time, it was my graduation gift. One of the attractions we entered was the Empire State Building, it was fantastic. We went a sunny Thursday, around 11 am and it wasn´t crowded at all. Staff was nice and helpful. The views from the top are breathtaking. We bought a NEW YORK EXPLORER PASS for the two of us so we didn´t wait at all in queues. Just amazing, I will come back.",5.0,4.978

5594,Great Views - Wonderful New Observation Deck - Horrible Disorganization,"The attraction is 5 stars but the rating is due to the really ridiculous hassles.

Paid $93 each for two tickets - marked down from $98 each. These tickets were twice the price of a regular or ""value"" ticket and were supposed to mean there were no lines to wait in and we were to have access to the 80th, 86th and new 102nd floor as well as the museum.

Printed out my receipt, but still had to stand in line to get a ticket. That ticket said ""value"" because it was only $93. But all ticket takers thought is meant no fast access or access to the top.

Had to wait while at least four security guards checked on our tickets. They kept telling me we had no access to the ""red carpet"" line or the 102nd floor. This even though the second security guard/ticket monitor had given us VIP bracelets and I had a paper receipt that showed the access I paid for.

It was just a big hassle to wait while phone calls were made to verify the bar code on my ticket, other guards and officials were contacted and consulted. This inefficiency added about 30 - 45 minutes of unnecessary, wasted time to my visit. I did not have time to visit the new museum because I spent so much time explaining my access - had to catch a train.

This was a present for a good friend and it was embarrassing and definitely made the trip less fun than it should have been.

The new facility on the top floor is spectacular if you can get there.

They have added a store that you have to wend your way through to exit. It is overkill.

Definitely worth it to visit this place. My visit was only the 3rd day the new 102nd floor was open. Maybe they will figure out how to read the tickets after a bit more time.",3.0,4.9412

The experience on the way up is nicely done. I like the movie display incl King Kong Foto opportunity.

Taller and cooler than the Rock in my view. Same price.",5.0,4.604
5598,"expensive, crowded, a great view, but disappointing overall","We paid extra to go to the 102nd floor, and it just wasn't worth it. The base ticket to the 86th floor will get you to the observatory that you recognize from Sleepless in Seattle, and that really is all you need unless it's really important to you personally to see the same views from higher up. You take the elevator to the 72nd floor, then transfer to another elevator to the 86th floor, and then again to get to the 102nd floor. Each time you have to queue up",3.0,3.2192
5599,Not as good as last time,"The staff is always pleasant. We ordered the express tickets for this visit. The signage or lack of was noticed and had to ask the staff the whereabouts of the express line.Had to do this one several occasions. Folow the red carpet. Well, there was none. was a bit frustrating. The visit was safe and again, the staff was pleasant and informative.",4.0,4.787
5600,The view was amazing. Not to be missed,We decided to visit after dark as we had done top of the rock in beautiful sunshine. It was the perfect decision as the lights made it extra special. My only criticism is the trip to get there was rather disorganised. There seemed to be a lot of bottle necks even though it wasn't a particularly busy evening. Things could have been more polished.,4.0,4.8162
5601,Great time,"I got there at 8 when they opened with no lines and bought the regular ticket for the newly opened 102nd floor observatory and the old one.

5604,Worth a visit,We almost missed going here because we went to 'the Rock' but we are so glad we did. The Rock is just an elevator ride whereas here you have history all the way up and it's a prettier building with history. Definately worth a visit.,4.0,4.8142
5605,Iconic,You can share the views with King Kong when you go up to the top of the Empire State Building. The views are amazing. It is good to see the views during the day AND at night. Be prepared for some wind when you get to the top.,5.0,4.8162
5606,Great experience,"The exhibits have changed since I was there 8 years ago! We loved the videos/pictures of the men working on the scaffolds. This gave my granddaughters a better idea of how this building was constructed. It’s amazing how hard they worked in order to create this masterpiece!

We toured this building at night in order to see the lights of NYC! Beautiful and windy!!! One of my granddaughters is scared of heights but she ventured outside just for a few minutes while we were at the top. She was able to stand inside the glassed in area and was still able to see all around NYC! Great adventure and the lines for the elevator were not too terribly long.

But it's crowded and you have to put up with people taking too much time for that perfect Instagram photo. And it's pricey. But like my review title says, you have to do it at least once.

I will never return!",1.0,1.2818
5610,Amazing views of NYC,"Paid for the observatory/optional skip the line tickets. On our visit there wasn't a que so wasn't to bothered about paying for this option.
On arrival the staff were all very friendly and kept people moving security without any queing. Once we reached the top the views were outstanding as it was just starting to get dark so seen the city without the lights and then after 30 minutes the city lights were visible. Overall highly reccomended if you've never seen NYC from this viewpoint.",5.0,4.8468
5611,A must visit for first timers,"If it is the first time in NY or you never have been to the Empire State Building than this visit it is a must. Staff are friendly and you have the free time to look and walk around with no rush.

5612,"Disorganized, let too many people in at once, limited to no help","I took my wife and 3 kids to the ESB - the new museum and information related to the construction and history was well done - then it fell apart. The lines were disorganized, once you arrived at the 80th floor? by elevator - the lines were so long to get to the 86th floor they opened up the stairwell in a haphazard way and people scrambled to take the stair. The level of disorganization was downright scary, especially with kids. Sorry for the poor review - the museum and views were great but the experience to get to the top was awful, so bad we decided to forgo the 102nd floor observation deck even though we paid for tickets.",2.0,1.2012
5613,Enjoyed Visit,"The 102nd Floor is lovely and the views from all of the viewing areas are spectacular. The photo that they took at the beginning turned out great and I enjoyed having this souvenir of my and my daughter's visit here. We bought the Express Pass to save time and we were moved to the front of the line when we showed our ticket. Now, we did have to bring the Express Pass to the attention of someone as there wasn't a separate line once you get to a certain point in the tour.

5614,Empire State Building - a MUST for 1st time visitors!,"We arrived in NYC by train from Boston, checked into our hotel then walked round to the Empire State Building.

5621,What an amazing view!!!,"This iconic building was definitely on our bucket list of sites to visit while in New York. We read the advice online to try and get there early. That was good advice. No major queues and fast and friendly service from the attendants on every floor as we moved through. We were impressed by the museum but did not linger and we had come to see the views. We opted for both level 86 and 102 and I am really glad we did this. The view on level 86 was great, but it does not quite match the un-interrupted views from level 102. Wow, wow, wow!! The weather was fine (just a few clouds in the sky) and the control on the numbers of people up on level 102 meant we got enough time all around to see everything. No bars or barriers in the way to spoil the view.
It was definitely worthwhile going.... we loved it.",5.0,4.9814
5622,An outstanding experience of an NYC Classic,"I'm originally from NYC but those years are long behind me. As a kid my grandfather would take me to many of the sites of New York. He humored me by taking me to the Twin Towers of the old World Trade Center, but as an old-school New Yorker, he loved to hate those buildings. For him, the classics were the Chrysler Building and the Empire State Building. I've come to the conclusion that he was right.

The Empire State Building has a character that most other buildings lack. No longer the tallest in the world or the city, it is still an absolute classic. The staff at the building were fantastic at our visit, being very helpful when our digital skip-the-line tickets wouldn't scan (crank that brightness up on your phones).

The newly refurbished 102nd floor observatory costs extra to visit. We were a little hesitant about paying extra but I'm glad we did. The old ""portholes"" have been replaced by floor to ceiling windows and crowds are fairly light all the way up there. Definitely do the open air observation deck on the 86th floor as well - there is something about being out in the open that really connects you with the sights of the city.

Having visited the old World Trade Center and the new as well as the Empire State Building, I find the Empire State Building is the clear winner.",5.0,4.9692

5628,Great View,"I made sure I went for 8:00am when the tour opens. Good time no real lines or waits. The tour took me just over an hour to complete and it is worth the visit. There is help on all levels to direct you to your next exhibit or elevator. The best part is of course the observation deck where you get a real sense of the size of the city. I did buy my ticket ahead of time and chose a skip the line ticket. I would recommend this type of ticket if you plan to visit after 10:00am, not needed before.",5.0,4.8462

5640,Great experience for the whole family,"Great trip for the entire family, kids loved the King Kong attraction and the history behind the building.

5641,NYC Empire State Building,"Friendly staff easy up and down elevator ride awesome views and reasonably priced! We spent 2 hours here, a definite MUST when you travel to NYC!!!!!",5.0,4.8512
5642,Just before sunset,"Fortunate enough to have a lovely warm evening when we visited. We arrived at the lookout just before sunset so we saw the beautiful city of New York change from dusk to a glittering fairyland of lights. My personal favourite was the Chrysler building.
As you can imagine it was packed with tourists like ourselves, but the staff kept things running smoothly.. Give yourself plenty of time to take everything in. A beautiful city at night.",5.0,4.8478
5643,Awesome experience,"I would recommend everyone to spend the extra money to get the express pass to the 102nd floor. Worth every penny seeing that view. With the express pass you bypass the long hour+ wait and get to the 102nd floor in a matter of 15-20 min. Awesome and helpful staff. Wonderful experience.

Pro tip: order your Empire State Building souvenirs on their website and have them shipped to your house if you live in the country. Will save you a headache trying to fit it in your bags.",5.0,4.9256
5644,102nd floor!,"Purchased express/no wait pass to view new 102nd floor viewing deck. Great views. Skipped lines. Too many different elevators and had to scan tickets six different times to get to the top. Poorly organized and lacked direction...but all that being said, still worth the visit.",4.0,4.5565999999999995
5645,Get a skip the line ticket,Great views. Of note is that if you have a skip the line ticket you do not have to stand in lineups. Apparently the exhibit is understaffed as there was nobody to tell us this and one of us had to work our way through a huge line to find a representative. Other than that it’s historic,4.0,4.5012
5646,Empire State Building,The new 102nd floor observation deck is awesome....much better views than the 86th floor. Top to bottom glass walls makes the views so much better,5.0,4.53
5647,Jump the queue,We would recommend the online jump the queue tickets. Up and down in 40 minutes. Express lanes both up and down. Worth the extra money,5.0,4.0534
5648,"Crowded, but a must see","There are countless reviews. What I will say, timing is everything. It's not the wait to get in, but getting out may have been worse.

The stories leading up to the elevator tell the history which is interesting. It also takes two elevators to get to the observation deck. So two lines. Same going down unless they let you take the stairs. The views are awesome.",4.0,4.4454
5649,Terrible,"We bought our tickets ahead of time. The line for security took half hour. Then we got to the 76th floor, the line was another half hour. When we finally made it to the top, it was so crowded it was uncomfortable. My daughter could not look out bc of the crowd. Then we had passes to go to the 102nd floor. It was chaos between people trying to go down and people trying to go to the 102nd floor. It took us at least another half hour to get through the line to go up. When we got up to the 102nd floor, it was beautiful but again the size of the crowd was unbearable and a fire hazard. It was extremely tight quarters. It took another 20 mins of people pushing to get down. Overall, for the amount it cost, it was not a good experience and I would not recommend it.",1.0,1.3674
5650,Beautiful view and great informational displays,Wonderful visit with tons of information and unparalleled views! A must see! We chose to go at night because we were visiting the Trade Center Observatory the next day. Great gift shop.,5.0,4.8118
5651,LOVED IT!,I read many reviews where people said they liked Top of the Rock better than the Empire State Building. I personally don't understand that. The ESB was one of our favorite places to visit! It wasn't just the views at the top - it was the experience the whole way up. We paid more for the VIP skip the line tickets and they were worth every penny.,5.0,4.9
5652,Could have been better,"Overall the experience was good. However, I paid extra for the express ticket so I can skip the lines and make my experience smoother. BUT, there were no sufficient signs of express lanes or no staffs for directions. So we ended up waiting at the King Kong section for at least 30 mins since we didn't see any signs indicating we could take an express lane. There were no staffs there at all. Wish I could have my money back.",3.0,2.1192
5653,Must Go!,"Went to the 102nd floor the day it reopened to the public after its big renovation. I think it’s definitely worth paying the extra amount to go up there. No obstructed views unlike the 86th floor where you have the short wall and metal fencing blocking your sight. You can also see a broader range at one glance than you can at the 86th floor. My advice when you arrive is to enjoy walking through the 2nd floor and checking out the new exhibit then go straight up to the 102nd! You can always go back down to the 86th and 72nd floors afterwards so it’s best to hurry and get up there to beat the crowd. Also, I would suggest getting there between 8am and 10am (at the latest) to avoid crowds. If you do this you definitely won’t need to pay for that “cut the lines” add-on.",5.0,4.736
5654,Empire State Building ‘Sunrise’ Visit,"The ‘Sunrise’ Visit to the Empire State Building is a fantastic experience. The visit is limited to 100 people, and so is calm and unspoiled by crowds and queuing. The views are spectacular, the inside of the building beautiful, and the visitor centre is interesting and informative. Unfortunately, while some staff were friendly and welcoming, too many were grumpy, uninterested and borderline rude. They were also not very knowledgeable - I asked one person to help me identify a number of the landmarks below, but he knew absolutely nothing, which was surprising and disappointing. Service levels aside, the views and visitor centre make this experience worth every $ and the early start!",3.0,4.0568

5657,An Honor to the Trades! Amazing history lessons!,"I was in awe of all of the men showcased, representing all of the skills within the various trades that were needed to complete the Empire State Building in only one year! The interactive museum is a wonderful testament to man's ingenuity and determination! It is also a lot of fun for kids with the King Kong display. The observation deck was a lot of fun too! There was a light rain the day we toured the Empire State Building which meant that there were few tourists in the museum and on the observation deck. The views were still magnificent even with the rain and the bonus was having the place almost to ourselves! The tour of the museum and a visit to the observation deck is well worth the $$!",5.0,4.9532
5658,Movie Buff's Icon,Beautiful views of the city after dark. Observation area very crowded but getting there is very well organized. Bought tickets on site with no standing in line. A must see for King Kong fans! Anything King Kong related that you could ever want in the gift shop. Allow at least an hour and a half to two hours. Expensive ticket.,5.0,4.7303999999999995

5661,A bit disappointing,"Bought express tickets for $65 but when we got there, there were no queues. A risk you take but for the money there was no audio tour, not much info about the building, just the lift up, look at the view and back down again. Would do Top of the Rock instead.",2.0,1.5546

The observation deck was amazing! Definitely a must see attraction for family with teens.",5.0,4.9088
5672,This is NYC to me!,"Love this beautiful place. You can see it far away as you enter the city. There’s a good bit of construction going on but still you can get to the top. Beautiful views. Try to go early in the day to avoid the crowds. The place gets real busy.

5681,Best Icon of New York City,"We visited the Empire State building in NYC and it was incredible. It is NOT just a matter of getting to the top and looking out over Manhattan Island, it is the information that they provide along the journey to the top. There is a section were they note the movies that have used the Empire State building which is quite a long list. Lots and lots of history on the building as well as personal accounts of it getting built. Then there are the amazing views over Manhattan....just amazing.

I highly recommend a visit to this iconic site in NYC",5.0,4.8654

5685,Great Visit,"We did the 86th and 102nd floor, VIP Express option with my 6 year old daughter. She was in such a rush to get to the top we quickly flew by many of the new Interactive displays they have but the all looked great. We all really loved the 102nd floor and felt it was worth it as an add-on. As for the Express option? Probably not worth it. Even on this day we went in the late afternoon and it was the grand opening of the 102nd floor... lines were minimal. Not a very long wait wat all. So we probably could have saved that money. But it was an overall great experience, better than it was years in the past, My 6 year old daughter had a blast!",5.0,4.9806
5686,The View not to miss,"The Empire State building has not made it a destination. Rather than standing in line forever, they have made an interactive event as you head to the top. So much information on how it was built, by whom etc makes going to the Empire State Building a destination. We bought the regular ticket, not the express and had short wait times as many people took the time to read and interact with the exhibits as you head to the elevators. At the top there was plenty of room to get that unforgettable shot. Going back down you have an option to walk from he 86th to the 82nd floor rather than waiting for the elevator. We took that, to beat the crowds. At the end of the tour you have to take the walk of retail through the gift shop before you can get out. Don't miss this amazing classic of NYC.",5.0,4.7742

There was a short line and 15 minute wait to board another elevator that took us up to the main observation deck on the 86th floor. I have been up to the deck one time before, during the day, but I found that there was a real energy from the vibrant lights of the city at night. On the 8th of October, it was extremely windy, and moderately chilly. I was in short and a t-shirt though, while most people were bundled up in long pants and had on jackets and hats.

After getting our pass straighten out with CityPass, we were good to go - No waiting in line. We had downloaded the ESB app. Very useful. When we were on the 86th Floor Observatory, we found one of the Security Personnel very helpful and informative. It was a beautiful day and we loved our experience.",5.0,4.9302
5802,"WOW, amazing building","What an experience. The history of the building are laid out in a great interactive walkthrough. Unfortunately for us, we chose the wrong day as the weather was poor and the view from the observatory on the 86th floor were restricted due to mist and rain. This was our fault as we had opportunities ot visit on the previous days. Spend a little extra to purchase the open ticket, check the weather forecast on go on a nice clear day.

One thing which did spoil the experienece - while queueing to get pictures with the King Kong display, an official named Frank, who introduced himself as head of security thought it would be OK to jump in front of us with a group, never asked and thought they could get the pictures before us and without waiting. His reaction when challenged about what he had done was to say, these people are VIP's, and have paid $100 per ticket, they deserve to jump the queue. I told him he was rude, he eventually apologised, somewhat grudgingly but it didn't seem right that he seemed to be giving someone a personal tour and special treatment to the detriment of other paying customers.",3.0,4.571

5806,Beautiful view and experience,"We loved the beautiful view from the 86th floor. The experience was very well orchestrated. Not as high tech as One World Trade of course, but appropriate for this classic icon. The view was not as dizzying as OWT, possibly because the viewing deck is outside. There also aren't any windows here to put glare on your pictures. The lines were short and pretty efficient when we went.",4.0,4.8546
5807,Sunrise visit,"Expensive visit for a short time but when I reviewed the photographs and how good they are it was well worth it . Fortunately it was clear and we did see the sunrise . Slightly disappointing that it wasn’t completely dark on getting to the top . There were only about 30 people and no crowding . At 6am on a clear day it was extremely cold again limiting the time spent there ! Also for the city that never sleeps there were very few people about before 6am apart from the ‘odd’ person standing in a doorway or a construction worker going to work . As we walked about 15 minutes to get there if doing it again would get a taxi .
A cheaper option might be to go before dusk and watch the sunset.",4.0,4.7762

There are lots of things to read about the construction of the Empire State as you go up. Ultimately it’s a tall building with a great view and it gets very windy, so bring a jacket.

5844,Still the best view in town!,"Its a tourist-trap, allright. But the view is still magnificent, and the open-air terrace makes you fell closer to the city, than just viewing from the inside. If you are into heights and views, this is the one I recommend. This is the second time I am up here, and since the last time, it has become even more touristy and rather expensive. Stay away from the most crowdy periodes and line is not too bad.",4.0,4.8484
5845,High price tickets,If I have five more family I couldn't get in this Building. If they have a choice to make like a second option (halfway Building view/half price) it's might help for some families. That I though. I took only one daughter this Building,3.0,4.2738
5846,Fantastic New York views,Enjoyed an afternoon visit and stayed to watch the sunset & city lights. The exhibitions on way to lift were really great & interesting. Offering free binoculars at top really added to the experience & helped get our children more involved by searching our features on some of the buildings. They also used the app to pinpoint certain buildings. It was very crowded but we managed to see the views from all sides. A wonderful NY experience.,5.0,4.8646

One world observatory provides wider and more varied view, Top of the Rock allows you to photograph both Central Park and Empire State Building itself. But for us New York visit would have felt incomplete without visiting Empire State Building.
We visited one weekday afternoon with the regular ticket. There was not much of a rush and we went to the observation deck without any delay. My favorite part of the visit was not being forced to take photos through glass. I wish we could have visited during evening time but our schedule didn't allow that. Overall we had a good time and do not regret our decision to visit.",5.0,4.9302
5864,Holiday visit,"We visited this iconic building and were not disappointed. Although the 102nd floor was closed the views from the viewing platform were magnificent. We had fine weather which made all of the difference. The viewfinders assisted in finding other buildings in the locality. The history centre prior to getting to the platform was very interesting advising how the building was constructed.

5875,Visit,"My visit to the Empire State Building was not a disappointment. It was a bit expensive, but the staff were friendly. The only thing I would say, if you charge so much for the visit maybe make the photographs of groups less expensive, it doesn’t make much sense to print out photographs and those that are not bought just trashed, surely the cost of wasting them outweighs the price of reducing them. It does get busy and they let the supergroups in as well which can be annoying,",4.0,4.3515999999999995
5876,Great overall experience with Charm,"We were lucky enough to visit just after the renovations in 2019 were completed and couldn't be happier with the experience. (better than Top of Rock by far, but you go there to take a photo of the Empire State!)
There are loads of reviews for the old building and I really can't add anything new except to say the experience, the staff, the new refurb were all excellent and classy. Old world charm from the staff and building.
Don't forget to get a photo with King Kong!

We were there early October about 11am and nobody else was. Bought tickets online and walked straight up, no waiting. Wandered around the exhibit and interactions before going outside, blessed with a glorious day. There is a downloadable App for those that like to walk around and listen to a self guided tour, like my wife, which is a great bonus.

Very pleasant experience all round, and a big thanks to the staff who went out of their way to be jovial and interact with us. Maybe because no one else was there and they were having a comparably easy day for them, but we'll take it!",5.0,4.9922
5877,Late with no breakfast that was purchased.,"We arrived 15 minutes early and no one was there to let us in. We stayed in the cold for over 20 minutes. It too so long to get upstairs that we almost missed the sunrise. We also purchased breakfast with our tickets and when we asked about it we were told it would be downstairs. After following the elevators and stairs down, we were lost with no one being able to tell us about our breakfast. Until we ran into a worker who informed us that breakfast isn’t being served because the place is closed. We were told to go back up to the ticketing counter. We when walked back up they informed us we needed to contact them online. There is no number just a form to email. Two days later and still no reply.

The external platform was just a solid block of humanity especially on the South Side - if you are in a wheelchair just forget it.

5890,Fabulous open air views of New York!,"We had access to the Empire State Building as part of a Big Bus Tours package (included in 2 day bus tour) so it was actually very good value. For our first day in New York it was rainy and overcast, so we were quite worried that we wouldn't see much. However, on the afternoon of the second day, the clouds parted and it became a beautiful sunny day.

The Empire State Building was also just around the corner from our hotel (Hilton Garden Inn New York/West 35th Street) so we stopped by for our tour on the way back to the hotel to freshen up. It was an amazing experience. It wasn't that busy due to the weather having been poor initially, so there were no crowds.There is a bit of delay built into getting to the viewing level, probably to allow for bigger crowds and to reduce the crush.

Once at the viewing level, the views are just fabulous! It takes some time to move around the full viewing area due to there being so much to see. Having been on the bus tour beforehand, we knew of enough landmarks to look out for them and to then enjoy them from a height. The views are great! You can see enough detail to recognise loads of landmarks. I think it also makes it feel special that you are outside and can enjoy the sun and wind as well. We also did the One World Tower later in our trip and found that whilst the views were good, the whole experience was a little underwhelming and definitely not as good as the Empire State Building tour - obviously that is a personal feeling for ourselves and others may feel differently.

Overall, we had a great experience at the Empire State Building. We hope to return and enjoy another tour but would also include the evening tour for a different experience!",5.0,4.9432

We made the most of the top for a short period , heaters are a new addition outside.

What made the experience better was the quality of the pre experience before getting to the top. Informative and fun and took the sting out of the weather ruining the finale.

At this time of year, the queues were non existent. I assume most buy on the day and were wisely not going due to the weather.

The first adventure in NYC was the Empire State Building. Our hotel was only a couple of blocks from it.
This attraction was definitely busy and had lots of activity. Several picture opportunities before you get to the top. The elevator ride was super fast and there are workers throughout the building for assistance. I would say the entire building is handicap accessible. Once to the top the view is tremendous and well worth the adventure. Walk the entire observatory as some sides had better views than the other. Lots of children and families were at this attraction. There is a price $$ but definitely worth it.
Some facts:
The Empire State Building is a 102-story Art Deco skyscraper in Midtown Manhattan, New York City.
It was designed by Shreve, Lamb & Harmon and completed in 1931. The building is the seventh-tallest building in New York City, the sixth-tallest completed skyscraper in the United States, and the 45th-tallest in the world.",5.0,4.9388000000000005

Not only is the view incredible but the building itself is great, very well maintained, the marble work is gorgeous, reading about and seeing pictures of how it was built was a brilliant touch, the staff / security who guide you in the correct direction etc were also fab, very polite and happy despite it being so late at night... oh and it was super quiet...

5924,Expensive but a must-see,"Although the tickets might seem experience, in my view this is a traditional ""must-see"" New York attraction if you've not done it. before.

The day that we went, it was very busy but the lines did move quickly. There are some exhibits to look at downstairs (like a Lego model of the building). Before you know if you're making your way upstairs in one of the elevators.

Once you're upstairs, you are then free to wander around and take photos. It was crowded but generally I found I didn't have to wait long to get space to take a photo that I wanted.

It was mid-morning and the views were great due to favorable weather conditions. I would avoid visiting if it is going to be cloudy.

Coming down afterwards took a bit of time, including routing us down a staircase at one point. I'm not sure if that was the usual crowd-control or if something was out of service.

Once you've seen it, you probably won't go through it all again, but if it is your first time to New York I highly recommend paying a visit!",4.0,4.9032

5931,Wow,"On a lovely sunny and clear day nothing in NYC can beat this view. A 360 view of NYC and its breathtaking.

The city is massive and this just shows you how big Manhattan island really is.

Definitely worth paying to go up and just experience the whole thing including some treats along the way.

Brilliant",5.0,4.929
5932,Cooler than “on the rock”,Empire State Building was so much nicer than “on the rock” observatory. It gave you a great history and you were allowed to take your time. Not as crowded. Great views.

5937,Always a great thing to do!,My family and I went right before sunset/golden hour. Lines were short until you got to observation deck. It was crowded to where you could barely pass through. Security would not let you stop at the upper landing to take a pic and made you keep going. We were not near any door to block it. Also has limited benches inside to wait. My son has a foot disease that requires him to sit and rest at times. He sat on the floor inside out of the way and was told he couldn't do that. Beautiful sunset sights to see but not happy with how the guards always made us move.,5.0,1.4902

It is always amazing to stand up there and look out on the city. Love the fact they redid the first floor.

They have put some extra effort in the details from the very begging of the entrance about the construction and the concept of the building (for engineers - there are floor plans, sections and details which I find very interesting).
It's not all about the view from the top, which by the way is breathtaking 🙂",5.0,4.8044
6008,Excellent adventure to iconic landmark,We went for the skip-the-line tickets since we didn't want to spend excessive time waiting to go up to the observation deck.

6017,Regular admission tickets,"I went here on a Sunday (9/29/19) afternoon with my boyfriend. We were surprised at how short the lines for the elevator rides were. We think maybe a lot of people wait for the sunrise or sunset times to visit, or tourists leave the city that day. We first stopped at the 80th floor which is mandatory. My advice is to skip this part, as it is all indoors. Keep walking to the next set of elevators which take you to the 86th floor. Here is the real experience where you can walk outdoors and take beautiful photos. There is typically an even higher floor you can visit for an extra price, but as of recent it is remaining closed for an unknown amount of time. Overall, it's a nice experience if you can find the right time to avoid the crowds.",4.0,4.0534

The history amazing me on quickly it was built in 1931. The viewing gallery is not covered on the top meaning you can get good pictures of yourself and the city.
Tickets could be slightly cheaper though as they add tax on top of the advertised prices so its $40 per person eventually.",4.0,4.8402

6029,Just amazing - VIP tour,"If you have the money book the VIP tour. It is expensive but boy is it worth it. We had just a group of 3 today, myself, husband and one other guest and from the moment your met by your tour guide your are treated like royalty. Our tour guide was Renita E and she is a local to New York and you can tell she loves her job. She has been with the building for over 21 years and she can tell you loads about the area and building. On this tour you get access to areas off limits to the general public and when you arrive at lift areas you go right to the front of the queue. Nothing is to much trouble for this lady, she will make sure you get loads of photos and takes most of them for you so me and my husband could be in them together. The views from the top are just stunning and Renita was able to point out all the local landmarks making it even more enjoyable.

6034,Excellent!,Amazing time with my two boys during our NYC Christmas vacation. This was my second time visiting the Empire State Building and it gets better each time. First time we came during the day and this time at night and it was truly breataking!,5.0,4.7436
6035,Night time visit to one of the most iconic buildings on the planet,Daytime queue was more than a little offputting so visited at around 10pm. WOW! Breathtaking views of the Manhattan skyline. You have to see this. It will be one of my great memories.,5.0,4.8346
6036,Feels great from top of Empire state,"It feels great when we see the city from the top of empire state building. In the lift and other area they have screens and sounds which gives amazing feeling, plus the information that how difficult was to built this building at that time which those amazing people did it fantastically.

great job team, and thanks for this unforgettable experience.",5.0,4.9224
6037,Great view!,It is very interesting to see the history of the Empire State! But the greatest is the viw over New York. Unforgettable!,5.0,4.7096
6038,A classic,I went here as a kid and it was as magical as I remember. We went at 11pm on a Sunday so there was no wait. The setup before going up was a nice touch. Seeing the city at night is totally worth it and perhaps better than going during the day.,5.0,4.3258
6039,A must to see.,"No line during our visit. Used our Explorer pass, no problem. Outstanding 360 views of midtown Manhattan, Jersey City and surrounding areas.",5.0,2.4536
6040,Don’t pay for photo,Do not pay for photo at end of your visit. They take a photo of you when you go in and give you a ticket. At the end of your tour they try to sell you the photo that was taken. When you buy it they give you one print and supposedly a ticket number to access photo online. It was about $25. The online access did not work. I have tried several times to contact the vendor with no response. Seems like a scam to me.,2.0,2.1555999999999997

wonderful views all around.",5.0,4.4702
6044,Empire State Bldg visit,"The folks that worked the lines and elevators where by far the friendlist security and staff we encounter during our NYC trip. Everyone smiled, interacted with the visitors and made the process fun. It was refreshing to not encounter snarling faces and nasty attitudes during the wait. Also, the displays and interactive learning experiences available while waiting for the elevator was really nice - we had no wait but the displays where so interesting that we took time to see them before we did the final trip to the viewing deck.",5.0,4.679
6045,Enjoyed the View,Must be Murphy’s Law; we purchased VIP tickets in advance only to find not a person in line when we arrived. The view from the sky deck was amazing and we were able to capture some great pictures before the clouds moved in. It’s probably a once and done attraction but something every tourist should have on their list.,5.0,4.632
6046,Empire State Building,"Awesome views, the elevator is small and hot. We used the fast pass and got right in. We had a lot of fun! I would highly recommend using the fast pass. We were able to get in to each attraction without the general admission and cruise right through all the attractions.",5.0,4.8916
6047,Great view rfom the top,Perfect view on a chilly evening. It has really changed since the last time I was there although that was years ago. The view is just as fantastic as the last time from all sides and it is terrific at night. Well worth the trip - and remember to take a jacket instead of just wearing a t-shirt like I did. It is quite a long way up and can get windy...,5.0,4.8846
6048,Empire state building at nIght,We had planned to arrive mid-afternoon but didn't make it until after dinner. What a blessing - the view at night was absolutely spectacular! No lines when we arrived and we truly had an amazing time.,5.0,4.8172
6049,Crowded:(,"the number of ppl on sunset time should be limited! it was way too crowded up there....
We enjoyed the view but the overall experience was not as good as we hoped for.",3.0,3.694
6050,Stunning,We chose to visit at sunset and we therefore had the daylight views coupled with the sunset and then the night view. This is definitely the best time to visit. Thoroughly enjoyable and unique experience.,5.0,4.7554
6051,First Visit,This was our third trip to Manhattan but our first to the ESB. We were really impressed with how well organized the flow through the building was. Your staff does a remarkable job in handling the crowd.,5.0,4.8414
6052,Worth it,"Thoroughly enjoyable couple of hours in a beautiful and iconic building. We had standard tickets and when we went in September at 9.30am, there were no real queues other than the standard security searches. Staff were very polite and helpful and it was worth spending time in the interesting exhibition before the lift itself. The views are spectacular with free telescopic units to use all the way round, tho might be chilly on a cold day! Can’t comment on the higher viewing platform as it wasn’t open on the day we visited, can’t imagine the view could be that much better!",5.0,4.9344
6053,SO WORTH THE PRICE,I have been to the city a million times and finally went to do this. Absolutely magical especially at night!,5.0,3.0
6054,Very nice view!!!,A very good experience!!! The exhibition floors are amazing!!! Very nice view at the top!!! A must go in NY!!!,5.0,4.8388
6055,Great Experience,We got the Express pass and went around 9am. We went right thru and passed all the lines. The view is terrific and really had a nice time. IF you are trying to choose between the Empire State Building and Freedom tower to visit for the view I would definitely vote for the Empire State Building. Much less touristy and hokey and you can go outside. Loved the experience!,4.0,4.9072
6056,A NYC must!,"My husband and I visited yesterday morning and I’m so glad we did. The views are spectacular and you feel like you’re experiencing a true part of the city’s culture.

We got there quite early, at about 9:30am, and although there was a bit of a queue it moved along very quickly. There’s plenty of information on the building’s history before you actually go up in the lifts. I imagine it can get rather busy at peak times though so I’d suggest visiting early on in the day to avoid the busy times.

Oh and make sure you take a jumper or jacket. We went on a gloriously sunny day but it was still quite windy at the top so wrap up!",4.0,4.7486
6057,Great Experience,"We chose to try the sunrise visit which was worth waking up early for. We had a great view of the sunrise and the city. The staff was so nice and generous. Everything was clean and well cared for.
There were no long waits and the top was not crowded.
We didn’t do the breakfast so I can’t comment on that.

I will say, because the ticket page does not, ALL prices are per ticket. The premium experiences, etc. are the prices per person, even though it appears it is the price for the group.",5.0,4.9212
6058,Iconic Landmark,"Although others offer just as good or better views of the city, the Empire State for us had the iconic title and formed great memories on our trip to New York. A must in the city!",4.0,4.761
6059,Fast and nice,"Staff very kind and helpful. Not many people, so the visit was nice in time and spaces. Very interested to see what kind of people have visited.",5.0,4.891
6060,Iconic building,"When I think of a NYC building, the Empire State Building always come to mind. Great view of the city although it was a bit crowded on the observatory when we visited. Best time to go would be during sunset so you could see how the city lights up when the sun comes down.",5.0,4.7038
6061,Great views,"Great way to see the city from above. I’ve done this experience a few times over my visits, but this time also did top of the rock. Now that I’ve done that, I’d choose that over Empire State. Don’t get me wrong, it’s gorgeous either way, but picture opportunities better at top of the rock (glass areas, no fences, and an open site area). Plus, at top of the rock you can get the Empire State Building in the background.
They’ve updated the entrance to the attraction from the years past that ive been. A nice picture timeline and some food picture places. We did the city pass for this attraction and had no issues redeeming. I do wish it wasn’t quite to expensive to do (hence city pass), as you really don’t spend too much time here.
If visiting the city this and/or top of the rock are must dos!",4.0,4.9664
6062,Sunrise view,If there is one thing you can do while in NY spend the money for the sunrise view. You avoid the crowds and to see the sunrise from the top is just amazing,5.0,4.0534
6063,Special weekend in NY,Many trips to NY first trip to the top of ESB. Has become way to commercialized to the point of a tourist trap. Done it and not interested in doing again.,3.0,2.1734

6065,This NYC/American icon is extraordinary!,"We have been visiting NYC for 50 years, and this was our first visit to the Empire State Building. We took our 9 year old grandson this weekend to see it. We all loved it! Very well done tour. Amazing views.",5.0,4.7712
6066,no lines,"We went early, around 9AM, no line ups, staff were very nice, good history and pictures throughout and great views.",5.0,4.694
6067,Stunning exhibits,"In addition to the thrill of visiting an iconic building, the route to the top is filled with stunning exhibits that make the trip informative and fast paced. It’s a “must see” in New York City!",5.0,4.469
6068,Empire State Building-Too Cool,Did the AM/PM. It was so neat to see the city both at day and and night. We were very fortunate in that there was no line either time we visited. Great experience!,5.0,4.7642
6069,Amazing,"We went on the Empire at 7 P .M
We didn't wait too much to arrive to the elevator. On the outside platform there were already many people to observe the sunset. It was something emoting. The view was extraordinary. It was difficult to arrive in the front to see better and to make pictures and to film but we could arrive also in the front and we could take wonderful pictures from two sides. We stayed there almost 2 hours. The sunset was spectacular and the whole view we had from the top of the Empire.",4.0,4.6302
6070,VIP Guided Tour,"Wow what an amazing tour of one of the most iconic buildings in the world. I would have to say that Renita E our tour guide was quite simply outstanding, her love and passion for the building was in abundance and made the tour and she was simply the nicest person we have met in the US. It was a real treat to jump the line for elevators and picture opportunities which was the icing on the cake. I would thoroughly recommend this tour as you get a real feel for the building and see and hear things that you quite simply wouldn’t see on your own. Well done Renita E, we will never forget you and thanks for making today so amazing!",5.0,4.9814
6071,The Empire State Building,"Once again the tallest building in NYC, the views here of the Manhattan skyline are incomparable. Visit at least once in your life so you can say you did.

Go late, preferably after midnight, on a weeknight and you will save yourself the epic wait. Last elevator up is 1:15.

You will go through a metal detector, so Texans, leave your guns at home. You can't check them in anywhere, and you WILL be arrested, because: NYC. This has been something of a ""thing"" in recent years so I include it for that reason.

Be sure to dress for the weather. Unless it's summer, it may be substantially windier.",5.0,3.463
6072,Expensive but worth it,"We really enjoyed our visit to the Empire State Building very much! It is very well thought out, especially the tributes to past dignitaries visits & successful movies filmed on location. Extremely friendly staff! Getting outside at the 80th+ floor was amazing! Appreciated the free viewing binoculars! Dress warm as it gets windy! Tip: Try to go during slack times.",5.0,4.961
6073,Visit to Empire State Building,Hadn't ever done this before and am glad I did. We had a multi-day Hop On Hop Off Bus pass and the entrance was included. Good way to see.,5.0,4.4192
6074,Amazing!,"I’ve been wanting to visit the 86th Floor Observation Deck for years. Wow.
We went at sunset and saw the lights come on across New York. Amazing views on a clear evening.
Would absolutely recommend the additional cost of the VIP ‘skip all the lines’ pass - we were up there in a flash.
Wonderful experience.",5.0,4.9342
6075,1st Time in NYC,Loved visiting the Empire State Building! We had the city pass which allowed us to visit during the day and then at night. Also enjoyed the interactive rooms that you walk through on the way to the elevator. A lot of fun information and things to see for our teens and our 4 year old. Definitely will visit again!,5.0,4.8596
6076,Mr Mrs Holt,"We had an amazing time, all staff were very friendly and helpful it was just a bit hard having to stand in queues as my wife has a stick but other than that it was great",4.0,4.8056
6077,"A symbol, icon, and must-see attraction","How could our first trip to NYC not include a stop at the world’s most famous tall building? It helped that our hotel was only about three blocks away and this was part of the CityPass that we purchased. On your way towards the top, you’ll pass at least three small versions of the ESB. There’s also some areas where you pass large video screens that make it look like you’re walking through the ESB when it was under construction. A favorite photo op is where you can pose with a giant gorilla hand that has apparently punched through the wall and they project King Kong looking in through the “windows.” You also pass through a large gallery of famous people who have visited this landmark. On the way up, they project a short film on the ceiling of the elevator. Guess it goes without saying that the views from the 86th floor observation deck are fantastic, but they’re also a little different than the views from the two other most popular tall buildings in NYC. We also visited The Top of the Rock at Rockefeller Center (another part of the CityPass), which is further uptown (north), and gives a better (but not fully unobstructed) view of Central Park, whereas ESB has a more Midtown location. By the way, if you’re looking for The Top of the Rock from the ESB, it’s the building marked “Comcast.” The other popular observation point is One World Observatory, which we didn’t visit, but which is located downtown (south), much closer to the tip of Manhattan and the Statue of Liberty. I also liked the very retro uniforms worn by ESB employees and the very art deco signage overhead when you reach the observation level. On the way out, which also takes you through ESB’s huge gift shop, don’t miss the art deco relief mural in the lobby, which features a dramatic image of the ESB in steel, aluminum, and gold leaf.",5.0,4.9808
6078,Great visit!,We paid for express pass - well worth it as we were able to access to viewing platform without stopping from the time we entered the building.,5.0,4.0674
6079,On Vacation,"Very good experience, I won the fear of heights,
the weather was excellent and you could see the whole city",4.0,4.6502
6080,Unreasonably expensive,"The views are great, but not worth the ticket price. I was not impressed with the displays. There is really nothing worth seeing but the outside views.",2.0,1.834
6081,Average,"I was really excited about this visit and it's not cheap to do either. We paid for the jump the queue tickets and when we got there there was only a handful of people in front of us anyway. I guess that's the luck of the draw though. We got to the top and it was so windy, it literally took your breath away! We spent about 30 minutes on the viewing platform and, like the Shard in London, once you've seen it that's it - you've seen it. There are only so many times you can view Central Park and the buildings. I heard that Top of the Rock was a better view, so perhaps look into both before deciding which one you want to spend your money on.",3.0,4.8458000000000006

6087,Much improved experience.,"Visited back in 2001 and much has changed. Was easy to obtain a ticket, the queues went quickly and was even given the option to take the stairs for the last par (which I did). View from the top was as spectacular as I remembered it despite more tall buildings having gone up in the meantime.

Enjoyed this second visit immensely. Although would hate to be up there during peak tourist season though as I couldn't see any way that they could limit the number fo guests out on the viewing platform.",5.0,4.1148
6088,Nice view,Absolutely beautiful view from the top. They were working on the floors above so we could only go up to 86 but it was amazingly awesome,5.0,4.7028
6089,"Long waits, great views","We went at around 5pm and it was very busy. We got into the first set of elevators pretty quickly (up to the 80th floor). However, the last set was a 2 hr wait. As such, we were given the option to climb the last 7 flights of stair, which we opted to do. Stairwell was pretty cramped (only meant for 1-2 people at a time I think). Was pretty hot and sweaty by the time we got to the top, but it was worth it. One tip: we had the explorer pass and it made ticketing much smoother. You can skip tickets lines and just present your explorer pass at the turnstile.",4.0,4.587
6090,Magic at night,"I had previously visited during daylight and the top of tourist season so this time I decided to take a 10pm trip and I was well worth it, although busy not as overcrowded so the narrow walkway around the top was easier to get through with lots of places to stop and take in the views of the city at night. Do wrap up warm though as the night air is sharp.",5.0,4.5928

6093,A Must,"Oh, come on, you can't visit NYC without going up in the Empire State. Yes, it's a bit tacky, and no, the view isn't what it was a few years ago. But, it is a building that defines the city skyscraper, and it's in the middle, more or less, of the rest.
I haven't been in a while, I confess. My favorite buildings are the Woolworth Building, The Chrysler, and the Empire State.
I'm sure it's very touristy. But if your a tourist, embrace the fun of being a tourist.",5.0,4.8786000000000005

We did it the night and we don't regret it. It was spectacular. But there's only one thing that I regret and it's to not have been better covered up than I was. We had a beautiful weather the entire week and it was hot but high up there, all we could feel was the wind. Apparently. We thought it was just the cold but a guard told us it was just windy.

Totally recommend visiting this iconic building :)",5.0,4.805
6113,Great experience once we got the tickets,"Let me start by saying that it’s not obvious on the Viator paperwork where to get the tickets. Calling the vendor number we were disconnected 3 times and then it appeared they weren’t picking up. I called from my cell and got an immediate response. I explained what we had, what we needed, that we’d already been disconnected several times and asked who could actually help us. I don’t know the name of the person but she was very helpful and got us to the correct place. In case you’re wondering: go inside the Empire State Building, upstairs to the second floor, through security to the ticket booth. There you will get the tickets for dinner and the express line.
Dinner was great. We had a 5 pm reservation so we could go up for sunset. As we arrived early we took a seat at the bar and had a drink while waiting. Dinner was delicious and by the time we finished, the place was really getting packed.
We then went to the second floor, through security and took the “express “ lane. Let’s be clear. Express means you get to the front of the line for the first elevator. Then you join everyone else in line to get to the observation deck elevator. We were lucky that line wasn’t too long and we were able to get outside as the sun was setting for some beautiful views and pictures.
TIP: even if the weather isn’t too bad at ground level bring a hoodie or jacket as it’s very windy and can be quite cool at the top.
Overall I would recommend this tour. Just know where to get your tickets.",5.0,4.984

A lot to look at in the exhibition before going in the lift, then absolutely incredible views from the top!

They take a photo of visitors against a green screen, but as I found in other NY attractions, the prices of these are extortionate.",5.0,4.7562

6122,Great time!,"Its one of those iconic places you should go and see... yes, its pricey but worth it all. We went on a Monday around 4:30 and there was no queue",5.0,3.2054
6123,Iconic must see,Our first point of call and so glad we visited. Truly amazing. Great history and amazing views. Look out fo4 they and of King Kong. I would recommend doing this first before any other high view skyscrapers as Top of the Rock is a superior view and One World Observatory is the highest but ESB has a special magic feeling to it.,5.0,4.9094
6124,Great view over NYC,Fantastic view by night over Manhattan! A must see for your New York visit. This was my second time up there.,5.0,4.1966
6125,Worth every minute,From start to end the family loved it. The history is presented in an interactive way and the building is breathtaking.,5.0,4.569
6126,Must see,The views were spectacular! The art deco architecture is just beautiful. Well worth seeing on a trip to New York.,5.0,4.6032
6127,My experience,"The building is fantastic because it is very tall and it has lots of history , has a beautiful NY city panoramic view but I thin that it should have more toilets But is awesome",5.0,4.772
6128,Busy but worth a visit,I worried we wouldn’t get a ticket as we hadn’t precooked but it was fine. We turned up 10am on a Thursday morning & walked straight in. It is expensive like everything in New York but the exhibition on the walk up to the observation tower are very well done. It is extremely busy once you get to the top with everyone scrambling to take photos. The queues to get back down in the elevators are much longer than the way up but the staff are helpful & polite and it is well organised.,4.0,4.9074
6129,Great experience,This experience was more than just a view. Great interactive exhibit and really interesting walk through displays. Can highly recommend a trip to the top of the Empire State Building.,5.0,4.786
6130,Magical Tower,"The Empire State Building is a must do for the first time visitor. This is not only a viewing as you go through a few floors of history and lots of celeb stuff. We timed it to be there for Sunset and it was magical. I cannot rate this highly enough. It isn’t the cheapest but it has to be done. In the height of the season I would imagine the queues are really bad, so the fast pass would be a good option if going for the sunset and other busy periods. If going out of season, don’t bother with the fast pass.",5.0,1.672

6133,Impresion,"there should be more indications for tourists, magnificent view of new york.. thank you very much and greetings from Ecuador",4.0,4.7156
6134,Wow,"We went up around midnight.

Before even going up to the observation deck, you walk through an area with history on the building. There’s a room with big screens that have life sized video of the building of the Empire State. It’s very cool - it feels like you’re building the building with them.

The elevator is very impressive. It shows a video on the ceiling almost as if you’re travelling up while the building is being built.

The observation deck is narrow. I am deathly afraid of heights and I didn’t think about how windy it would be up there. It is very windy which just heightened my fear even more. Something to keep in mind if you’re afraid like me.

You can stay as long as you like. The night time views are incredible.

Overall I highly recommend and I would 100% do it again.",5.0,4.8116
6135,Well worth a visit,"My sister and I thoroughly enjoyed the views, the building is spectacular and you have time to take pictures and walk round to learn more of the history of this building and the people who built it. I would highly recommend this.",5.0,4.4992

Wasn’t really expecting too much of the museum but it was very well organised with interesting facts and visual displays. Going up to the top floor in the lift was an experience in itself as there was a short video to watch on its roof as you ascended. The views at the top were spectacular. We were even treated to a sit down on the official ‘Friends’ sofa to have some pics. Would recommend this attraction to everyone. Also, one tip I would say is get there early if you can to avoid crowds at the top!",5.0,4.928

6206,Still worth a visit,There may be better things to do in New York but the Empire State Building still does it for me. We were only in Manhattan for a day so couldn’t spend a lot of time at any one location but we did want to go back here. OK so it is not longer the tallest structure in New York but the history of it is worth finding out about and you get that best by going in and up. Well worth it in my opinion.,4.0,4.922
6207,As the skyline changes,"The Empire State Building will always be the tallest bldg in NYC for me.

6232,This is the real deal,"This is probably the most famous skyscraper in the world, Art deco not just ""modern"" now not the tallest, but a real functioning building, with commanding views downtown and midtown Manhattan, along with the surrounding harbours, it still delivers. It is almost impossible to get the feeling for the scale of New York on the street or from the water. If you go up one tall building in your life do the Empire State. (maybe also the Eiffel Tower). Admittedly I did it with no queues and a windless late summers midday, I suspect somewhat lucky!",5.0,2.5562
6233,Wouldn’t bother,"An easy review, other than being able to say you’ve been up the Empire State Building, it’s a waste of money. When you eventually get up there, you admire the views......then that’s it, your done, You can get equally good views from a number of other buildings or rooftop bars.

6239,Childhood dreams come true! Amazing view!,We had the NYC-Pass and could visit the ESB twice a day. We decided to avoid the crowdy times and choose 9am for the first and 10pm for the second visit. Both were absolutely awesome and we had not to wait for the up/down elevators.

6270,Blown away at Empire State,Unfortunately the weather was not good for our visit but we still enjoyed the visit. It was raining and blowing a gale and the view was non existent. But we can still say we have been and have photos of our experience.Due to the weather we did not have to worry about crowds so the extra paid for the skip the line was a bit wasted but probably worth it under better conditions. Do not let the weather deter you from this attraction it is worth doing rain or shine.,4.0,4.8688
6271,Empire State building,"A popular attraction and one of the things to do in New York, everything runs smoothly through security so get to the top real quick",5.0,4.6804
6272,Beautiful view; but far too crowded,"The views from the Empire State Building are spectacular! Since the last time I took the time to visit this tourist attraction about a decade or so ago, they have added a number of interactive displays for visitors to make the experience more enjoyable. However, unlike the last time I was there, they do not appear to be restricting the number of people on the observation deck. This is unfortunate!!
The crowds were so think that it was impossible to stop and enjoy the view outside. The only good pictures I got were from inside, and I had to wait “in line” to get near the window to take them. The last time I went, I was able to take my time to enjoy each of the amazing views. This time I felt like cattle being herded toward an end point. Considering the price you pay to enjoy the views, it is a shame that it is to crowded to actually enjoy them. If you have never been there, it is probably worth it; but, if you have been there before, you might want to skip it (at least in late summer and early fall).",3.0,4.801
6273,Must see views of New York City,"My husband and I are both New Yorkers and this was our first visit to the Empire State Building.
We purchased tickets there... it was about $82. for both tickets. We went on a Saturday night
(in September) after having dinner at the State Grill and Bar located on the first floor. The restaurant
was great (I posted a separate review). The views from the observation deck are stunning. It doesn't
matter if your a tourist or a native New Yorker this is a must see. And a perfect date night.",5.0,4.7682

6275,Treat to NYC,"Great trip to New York although incredibly expensive particularly food and alcohol, part down to the poor exchange rate but part due to the extortionate cost of living. Highlights were bus tour, Jersey Boys and ground zero amazing thought provoking tour",4.0,4.341
6276,A lifetime dream come true,As a little girl growing up in the North East of England my first memory of seeing America on TV is King Kong on the Empire State Building. I have always wanted to visit New York and this was always my top attraction. I have to admit I was nervous it would be a crash and burn but it was everything I hoped and more. We were lucky enough to visit on the Labour Day holiday and didn’t have to queue! The build up walking through is so well done and interesting and as a King Kong fan I was blown away. The views were just what I was expecting and it all lived up to my hopes and exceeded them. A fantastic time and unforgettable memories!,5.0,4.9722
6277,A must do attraction!,My friend and I visited the ESB during our girls weekend away and it did not disappoint!

Well worth a visit for a great experience!,5.0,4.9648
6278,A Bucketlist Experience,"It goes without saying that this is an essential to do item for anyone visting New York.

The experience starts with a look into the heritage and construction of the building with interactive exhibits including King Kong attacking the building before getting into the elevators to the viewing decks. The views were absolutely stunning. The only downside, it does get very busy and the tourists are extremely rude when you're trying to take pictures but cannot fault the friendly staff.",5.0,1.9936

6284,Fantastic,"Really enjoyed the climb and views, the staff were well trained and polite. We had a small wait to buy tickets on Easter Sunday all was good until an extremely rude women tried to jump the queue and when we said we were next we were subjected to a torrent of abuse. The lady at the counter served us and as we walked away the abuse continued. Security was called and her and her husband we shown out of the building. There were lots of Americans there apologising for her behaviour and reassuring us that they weren't all like that.
Everyone we met was always polite and well mannered. Theres always a bad apple.
The lift was amazing be sure to look up and views overlooking all Manhattan and across the water too.",5.0,3.839
6285,Good views,"As well as the really good views over the city, there is a fun exhibition on the way up. We enjoyed our time there and got lots of great photos! We went around 9.30-10am and it was pretty quiet - not really a line at all!",4.0,4.9254

Great view, great staff great experience. Approved.",4.0,4.9332
6287,"A bird""s eye view of New York City with the setting sun as a backdrop","As you enter the Empire State Building you go through a museum which takes you through the construction stages of the building, the VIPs and the Star attraction who have visited the building and the important organisations which function from there. What excited me was Priyanka Copra's photograph and that Shutterstock office is in this building. Then a very fast elevator takes you to the top floor after which we climbed the steps to the viewing gallery. And boy, what view. It was a clear day so we got a good view all around. We saw the city spread out before us, the symmetry, the concrete jungle and the green patches and the Hudson River. It was a great experience. We have visited NY many times since 2007 but this was the first time we went up the Empire State Building! Wish we had done it earlier.",5.0,4.8296
6288,Preferred to Top of the Rock - Fun Photo Ops on the Way Up - Iconic,"Fun to go online before your trip and look up the lights schedule. Then you can plan your visit date in order to view fun ESB colors, if you wish. We did the Top of the Rock and the ESB and preferred the ESB for the fun in going up. We didn't buy tickets ahead of time as we didn't know our schedule, however, the queue was short and it was a perfect. Fun photo op with King Kong and since my favorite movies were filmed there I enjoyed reminiscing.",5.0,4.9584

6291,Must visit attraction,"You can not visit New York without a visit to the iconic Empire State building.
Very smoothly run despite the massive amount of visitors. Friendly and helpful staff.
Best part is the observation deck, where you get amazing views of New York.
Tickets cost $38 dollars each, so not a cheap attraction to visit, but amazing nonetheless.",5.0,4.8134

6293,Sunrise experience and VIP tour - both splendid,"The sunrise experience (0600h local time) gives extremely impressive views of New York City in seriously excellent light (if one is lucky with the weather, at least, although sunshine is not in short supply in New York at the right times of year). Excellent photographs are to be had.

The VIP tour was quite a thing. I took the 0800h tour immediately after the sunrise experience and was the only person on the tour. The tour guide (Siobhan) was not only very knowledgeable but clearly passionate about the tower, and gave a splendid insight into the detailed history of the building.",5.0,4.9548000000000005

6298,September visit - no lines,"They don’t have timed tickets so you don’t have to worry about being there at a certain day or time. I bought my ticket online. What they don’t make clear is that your ticket is good for a year, which I thought was a great selling point. We went on a Monday near sunset so I thought it would be busy but we walked right in. No lines. It did start filling up at sunset but you could still walk around and get views from all sides.",5.0,3.5464

6302,NYC Getaway,"With the citypass we purchased we also decided to go to the Empire State Building. I had never been, but my wife has been twice. We went around noon on a Saturday. Luckily we had minimal lines and it only took about 20 minutes to get to the top. Last two times she was there it was 2 hours plus. They recently redid a lot of the interior, and they did a very nice job. When we got to the top I fell in love with New York City. Being able to stand outside that high up is amazing. I personally thought it was 100 times better than the freedom tower. You have amazing views from every single angle. It’s worth going up there and worth the wait if there is a long like. This is a must for 1st timers in NYC.",5.0,4.9878
6303,Better than expected,"The Empire State does of course have fantastic history and more resonance than most NY buildings.

We decided that if we woke up early one morning, we'd go straight there which we did and were there shortly after 8am.

There were therefore no queues and no hassle.

The view is spectacular as you would expect but a real bonus were the exhibits on the way up, that really added to the sense of occasion and doing something special.

We loved it.",5.0,4.8902

6306,Just as I imagined,"Our visit to the Empire State building was just as I had imagined. The inside was grand and has been kept in the art deco style. The staff were helpful telling us where to go depending on what tickets we had. The views as you go up each section are amazing and there are small attractions on your way up. The observatory deck is quite spacious, even with lost of tourists with bags. The best thing I found was the viewfinders which are still free, for now. Unlike the Rockefeller building. You get stunning 360 views of Manhattan and some great memories. We were told to do the Rockefeller if we had to choose between the two, but I much preferred the Empire State building.",5.0,4.8254

6310,Worth the Wait!,"The pictures from the top of the Empire State Building you see in books or photographs don't do enough justice unless you've been there, and I was lucky enough to go to celebrate my birthday week. There were plenty of people at the observatory on a weekday, but it was very organized and all of the staff was friendly and helpful. There were different types of exhibits exploring the history of the construction of the buidling, how it was featured in many films over the years, and even a chance encounter with King Kong! Once you get to the 86th floor, it is so beautiful. You could see so much from there, from the East Side to the West Side. I must've taken so many photos of this great site and up at the top, and now I can't wait to print them out and hang them on my wall in my apartment. Highly recommend!",5.0,4.9774

6313,Magical,"We have been to New York before and visited the empire states during the day and said the next time we go we would visit at night. It was beautiful, we had booked online before we went. You can book a day but not specific time and the great thing is it doesn’t close until 2am. If you get the opportunity, visit on the anniversary of 9/11 when they illuminate the sky with two shafts of light to represent the twin towers from battery park.

If you are lucky during the day with a blue sky you can see all the city and you can understand how high you are, it seems you can touch the sky, every building or hotel seems small compare to you.

6339,Amazing,Amazing views of the city!! Super interesting photos of how the building was built too. I would highly recommend to everyone who travels to NY to visit the Empire State,5.0,4.8594
6340,Love the Empire State Building.,"This was the second time I’ve visited the Empire State Building. Love it and generally love New York.

I bought my ticket through Expedia / NY Explorer Ticket which caused me trouble as they didn’t send me the ticket only the confirmation. Thankfully the ticket lady at ESB had the telephone number for the ‘Explorer’ ticket organisers who sent me the ticket so I could get into the attraction. Relieved it wasn’t busy when we went (midday) so I wasn’t holding up the queues! We literally walked straight in.

Brilliant attraction. Will go again.",5.0,4.9464
6341,Empire State,"The view was amazing.Recommend to carry a small jacket as it can get windy at the top. I loved it. I went there around 5pm and the crowd wasn’ bad at all, straight through without any waiting around.",4.0,3.9534000000000002
6342,"Great view, amazing Building",Great view the moment you step outside. I did it at night and the view was breath taking. 5 out of 5 and for me the best view in New York.,5.0,4.7038
6343,Late night visit,I choose to visit late at night and avoid the crowds. Since the Empire State Building is open until 2am I did not see the need to play the elbow poke game during the day. We took a carriage ride down Broadway to get there which was really fun. The driver had a lovely French accent and when we told him we were Canadians he was really pleased. He went on to tell us his carriage was made in Quebec so we had some common ground to start out. He also wondered about the late hour visit. When I explained that it was much easier to see the view and the interior of the building without playing dodge ball he understood. We were the only people on site except for the staff We had a good time chatting with them and enjoying the lovely lights of the city. I really recomment avoiding the crowds whenever possible.,5.0,4.9315999999999995

6361,Family from Montana,Much improved from the last time we were there in 2001. We really enjoyed the history exhibit that we saw on the way up.,5.0,4.5426
6362,Must see,I'm from Chicago so I think that I may be a bit biased about this particular attraction (we have Sears Tower ~ sorry not going to call it anything else ~ and the Hancock Bldg) I was a little bit let down by the Empire State Building ~ the only part I really enjoyed was the fact that you could actually go outside to enjoy the weather and the view (neither of our buildings you can do that in) I wish that they had not taken so much away from the outer portion of the building ~ it's tight going through there with a large amount of people and not as 'roomy' as I had expected.,3.0,4.7554
6363,Excellent Observatory,Very well organized and smooth running tour. Helpful and friendly guides. The views from all four sides are amazing.,5.0,4.8082
6364,Its all about King-Kong and Empire State building,"We were there in 2nd week of September. It was a nice experience. For all individual who can relate with King-Kong era and its craze, it is really a must to have experience.
This is my 3rd observatory in Manhattan, NY. I would still consider One Observatory the best experience. It has best view of Statue of Liberty and Manhattan. Also it is fully loaded with latest technologies. Empire State and Rockefeller, hard to compare. If you can relate King-Kong and you have some soft spot for that, Empire State is for you. But if you want to see Empire State from outside and Central Park more closely, then go for Rockefeller.",4.0,4.6094
6365,Amazing,Apart from the small inconvenience of not being able to pay by cash the rest of the experience is out of this world. We went early Saturday morning in September and the queues weren't bad at all.,5.0,2.9742

6372,Over the Top City,"Went at night, no long lines, easy access and friendly staff. Clean throughout and awesome views at night. Security guard working the top was a retired New York Detective that shared his experience during 9/11, explained what buildings we were looking at and was extremely friendly. Well worth making this our last stop on our first trip to the city. Skip everything else, just make sure you visit the top of the Empire State Building.",5.0,4.9498
6373,Evening view from the top,"We arrived shortly before sunset on a Friday evening, so naturally it was busy. They notified everyone the elevator would be an hour wait, but did give us the option to climb a handful of stories, which only took approximately 5 minutes. Glad that was an option.",5.0,4.2248
6374,Amazing,"Everything works smoothly and it is very organized. The exhibition before the observation deck is fantastic. Amazing view, just breath taking.",5.0,4.6251999999999995

6377,Great weather - great view - no lines,"Process was smoothly. Loved the new ESB experience. Friendly staff to answer questions and give directions. No lines. (Visit between 3-5pm...before visitors for the sunset arrive!).
The only downside was that the tour no longer takes you through the beautiful lobby of this art-deco building. you only get a glimpse of it when crossing over an elevated walkway.",5.0,4.5802
6378,Amazing NYC icon!,"Unforgettable experience, never saw a sunset like this one, NYC metamorphosis from day to night in minutes !!! Both versions unimaginable!!!",5.0,1.986
6379,Empire State Building,"On the day I went, at 5 pm, it was a little overcast but one could still see far out in the distance. It was exciting to be there because I have always wanted to go and never made it until now. There were relatively few people there, and therefore no waits through all the winding hallways and exhibits on the way to the elevators to the observatory after I bought the ticket at the lobby kiosk. I saw so many ropes and stanchions it reminded me of Disneyworld, but was able to pass them all by. I don't know if it really gets that crowded, but if someone told me there was going to be a 2 hour wait, I don't know that I could have done that. Anyway, I really liked being up there at such an iconic place.",5.0,4.5552
6380,Awesome visit,"The tour was very informative, the staff was pleasant. The story lines were very well put together. I will visit again.",4.0,4.3802
6381,Unmissable,"In a city where heritage is not always well maintained, the Empire State Building stands out like a shining star. Fantastic experience, should be top of your list when visiting New York",5.0,4.4516

6386,Tom watch,Beautiful place with a beautiful view stunning picturesque and an amazing experience well worth a visit,5.0,4.9256
6387,Cheaper prices,"I really did enjoy seeing it and seeing all the history of it, but I personally feel 45 bucks is a bit much for just seeing up to the 89th floor. But it truly is a beautiful building and I'm glad I got to see it.",4.0,4.8944
6388,Awesome!!,"we loved the visit to the empire!!!
the building is under reconstruction signs are missing in the building to know where the entrance it",5.0,4.1076
6389,Empire State Building,"I have not been to the Empire State Building in quite a few years. They completely changed the entrance and process prior to getting on the elevators to the 86th floor.

The security process is the usual--as any other touristic site. Hurried, unsmiling, not very nice associates. One would think, since this is a VERY touristic site and visitors come for all over the world, security would be trained in patience, culture and understanding that most visitors may not speak English. Nevertheless we got through the process.

The rooms getting to the elevators are very nice. The rooms are museum like. History and the wall of photos are displayed throughout the various rooms and a nice touch that is shared with visitors.

We were fortunate enough not to have waited long, however, I could see they expect very, very long lines.

Once we got to the 86th floor, the view is breathtaking. It was a beautiful crisp day. You can see as far as the eye could take you. Again the security at the top are just as friendly as when you first come into the building.

The 102 floor was closed due to renovations.

Overall it was lovely. My visiting relatives enjoyed their visit.",4.0,4.952
6390,A Must See!!,The Empire State Building is an amazing icon of American history and an architectural marvel. Strongly recommend getting the City Pass ticket for both day and night visits!!,5.0,4.7905999999999995
6391,Amazing!,We chose to visit the building at the end of the day and it was the best choice. The sunset was fabulous with an incredible sky. We were there when the lights of the city started to shine and stayed until completely on. It is such a magical moment. Unforgettable!!!,5.0,4.7164
6392,Love it!,Everything about the Empire State Building was great! The staff was very friendly! The view was amazing! My ears popped while I was in the elevator!,5.0,4.8536
6393,Skip the line ticket not worth the extra,"Great excursion and a must do, when in New York, with fabulous 360° views. Only down side was that we paid extra for skip the line queue, which wasn't worth extra money as it added no benefit whatsoever.
If you planning this when visiting then just buy the ordinary ticket",4.0,4.6482
6394,Family trip,The best trip of our holiday. The view was spectacular and the interactive treats on the way up where we'll though out and totally enjoyable. The food afterwards was delicious and we were spoilt and very happy. ☺️,5.0,4.9142
6395,Fantastic building,"An iconic building and definitely one of my favorite buildings in New York.
Bought tickets in advance and visited it an hour before sunset. Almost no queue. Nice exhibition about the building and a fantastic view.
Well worth the money.",5.0,4.8347999999999995
6396,What a view!,"Great view. We bought our tickets from the Sightseeing Bus group for $28, so a bit cheaper. The lines move fast and lots of staff to help you along. The elevator ride was really cool, I won't give it away. An amazing view, and a must see.",5.0,4.8431999999999995
6397,Nice but overpriced,"Came here since my wife hadnt been here for 20 years, really cool place, nice and clean, but for what you get, was a bit overpriced at $43 a person. And then they want an extra $22 for a family photo... and they dont even wait till you look at the camera just rush you through the line.",4.0,4.2568
6398,Fantastic visit,"Great experience. Was pretty crowded but the staff managed the elevators well and clear lines. Was a bit gutted the AM/PM tour meant you had to come after 9pm as late for kids but the night view is not to be missed. Had the package meal added at Tacombi in the ESB - wow! Amazing! Great food, staff and Pina Coladas!!",4.0,4.9704
6399,Visit in New York,"The express line was not necessary, but hey, the view was great!
If you go in the morning it has few people, in the evening it probably looks different.",4.0,4.5742
6400,Empire state building,The views are worth every penny and you are not rushed so you can enjoy it at your liesure. Make it a must do.,5.0,4.3114
6401,Not the best views and too crowdy,"Went there after Rockefeller and one world and the view was ok. best views of NYC has Rockefeller. From Empire has only half that you can see. Was not too impressed. Bunch of tourists around, Chinese trying to get pictures and jumping on top of your head and pushing you around. Also view is blocked with cage and there is only 1 observation deck comparing to rockefeller and not enough space.",3.0,4.0986
6402,A must to visit,"We were told to either do Top of the Rock or the Empire State Building, so glad we did them both. I would not have missed it for the world so worth the money",5.0,4.684
6403,Great view!,"It was such an amazing view and also the atmosphere there. No more word to say, you need to see it!

PS: King Kong is cool!! :D",5.0,4.7384
6404,Empire State Building - Amazing,"On my recent visit to New York we took in the Empire State Building. It had been a beautiful day and we arrived at the top just as the sun was setting. What a sight! We were there until darkness fell so we're also able to enjoy the sight by night. Truly spectacular. Even though it was quite crowded there was lots of opportunities to take in the amazing views from all corners. The journey up was also incredible and informative, not just a trip in an elevator. Would totally recommend thus activity, especially at the time we did it, 18.00.",5.0,4.92
6405,A visit to the Empire State Building,It was a Awesome Visit and really enjoyed the ambiance. Enjoyed the visit thoroughly with the attraction on the first two floors along with additional attraction on the 79th Floor. The Lift was awesome too with the display.,5.0,4.9412
6406,Excellent!!! The only way to see the Empire State Building!!!,Outstanding!!! Our tour guide was exceptional!! It was the Best tour I have been on!! She was extremely knowledgeable and generous with her time and attention to us.,5.0,4.8634

6409,Must do for the bucket list.,"There are very few things you can say you have in common with King Kong.The Empire State Building IS NY,",5.0,3.0
6410,Iconic Building,"This is one of the world's most iconic buildings and the visit is a real gem of an experience with great views. The whole King Kong exhibition was awesome too. We visited the Freedom Tower the day before and the Top of the Rock the next day after. Out of all three we loved the Freedom Tower most and preferred the Empire Building than Top of the Rock, now bare in mind we seen Top of the Rock at night. Rockefeller center was way more busy with scheduled waits of 2 hours and Staff was more helpful and courteous in Empire Building than Top of the Rock.",4.0,4.973
6411,An Old Favourite,"We fitted the visit in alongside a Macey's shopping trip which is only a short distance away, there are some interesting historic pictures and background to the building, the viewing summit provides wonderful views across New York and is manned by plentiful and knowledgeable staff, only gripe is that there could be some details of the buildings you see. We visited at just after 9.00am and walked straight in without queing, if you are only in New York for a couple of days I would suggest the Rockefeller centre may be a better choice",4.0,4.7614
6412,Very good attraction,"Very well organized, nice and polite emploeeys. I recommend to go there early in the morning to catch the sunrise over Manhattan.",5.0,4.5760000000000005

The views from the top are absolutely breathtaking in every direction! You'll be glad you took time to experience what this icon has to offer.,5.0,4.8225999999999996
6414,The Real Deal,"Some people say that the Empire State is over-rated, or that Top of the Rock is better because you can't see the Empire State from the Empire State! Well they're wrong. This is one of the world's most iconic buildings and the visit is a real gem of an experience. You don't need to pay for a fancy skip the line ticket if you go early, even in high season. Get there for opening time and you'll be pleasantly surprised at how short the line is.",5.0,4.6136
6415,Wonderful Experience,We had such a wonderful time at the Empire State Building. The process for getting into the building was so smooth and organized. We did not wait long at all and everyone working the lines was very cheerful and helpful. We had such a wonderful experience there. The view is spectacular. We got the AM/PM tickets which allow one visit during the day and another at night after 9:00pm. This is the best way to experience the Empire State Building and the 360 degree views. I highly recommend this ticket for anyone wanting to experience both views.,5.0,4.9448
6416,A must do experience in the Big Apple.,Arrived in NYC in the afternoon and once organised in our hotel it was straight out to the Empire State Building but it was dark on arrival. The exhibition about the building of it was interesting and the lift up to the top was good with the visuals above but boy that elevator was like an oven. Out on the observation deck the view across the city from all points was great but I think it would have been better during the day when you could get a better view of the sprawling city.,4.0,4.9622
6417,Empire State- not just for tourists,"Great fun, great view- they do bring the building to life with the exhibits on how it was built and the movies it’s been a part of it.",4.0,4.82
6418,Spectacular place - worth to be there,If you considering to go to Empire State Building - stop doing that and just go there. It's one of the biggest and most famous place in New York and should be on the top of your list of places to see in New York. I've been there two times and everytime when I was there view from observation desk impressed me. During the second visit I could not be on 102nd floor because it was being renovated and closed for tourists.,5.0,3.8038
6419,A visit to the top of the building is a must when in New York,On our first visit to New York we decided to go into the Empire State Building and go up to the top floor to see the views over New York. We were surprised how much information was provided in a small museum showing how the building was built and how the men built this very high building in 1930. There were also videos of the men working. The views from the top were amazing and you can walk the full circle around the building. It was a bit busy with people but they have a good system where staff help you through the building.,5.0,4.8022
6420,Wow,"Wow, what an incredible visit. Yep, I’ve seen most of the movies that include the Empire State Building and I wasn’t expecting it to be as good as it was.

6426,Amazing view,"I cannot compare the Empire State to the view from One World Observatory because we did not do the latter, however, I will say the Empire State building was incredible. We went first thing in the morning and we weren't the first ones there but we also did not have to wait in lines.",4.0,3.0
6427,Marvelous views,"This was the trip that I was waiting for years, The stunning views of the city Of New York are a must to see.

Our family used the stairs to climb the last 8 floors to reach the observatory desk.
It was an unforgettable experience.",5.0,3.8038
6428,VISIT TO OBSERVATORY,"It’s was awesome with very friendly staff! The view on the top is unbelievable.

Everywhere was very clean and bright and obviously the views are amazing.
Well worth a visit.",5.0,4.9478
6430,Day in NYC,Worth every penny. Was able to skip the long lines and go right along up the elevators and onto the observation deck without waiting. Same thing coming down.,5.0,3.4526

6434,Amazing! No queues.,"Visited on a Thursday morning and last visited in 2008. I was dreading the queues to the top but there weren’t any. It has completely changed since 2008 as the journey to the top is split in to various security checks and then the tour of how the building was built. Lots to see, read and watch on your way to the top. On the way out you still get to see the old entrance that is the reception. All staff very friendly and willing to take photos if needed. The views from the top are amazing.",5.0,4.9148
6435,"Good experience, but crowded","I was very impressed with the view and building, but the observatory was too crowded, and we ended up going up 6 stories of stairs, which was very tiring.",4.0,3.5904
6436,Great experience,"We arrived for about 8am and there was no queing. The building itself is so lovely, as you walk in there is a brief history on the building. Also section on which movies it has been featured and what celebrities have visited. The view from the top is amazing. It was a bit windy and cold when we went up but didn't take away from the experience. The gift shop downstairs had a wide range of gifts which we did purchase from.",5.0,4.679
6437,AWESOME,"My title is the only review that I can do: JUST AWESOME. The view it's the best that I found in NYC and, before, you find an amazing museum with a special room for King Kong! If you are in NY you HAVE to go to the Empire State Building!",5.0,4.905
6438,A truly wonderful experience,"Bought a ticket online in the UK - seemed to be valid for 1 visit in a working week window- thought that I'd messed up the booking to be honest. However, I decided to visit early in the day to hopefully avoid the worst of the queues (the ticket is not 'timed' ). Arrived about 8:30 and there was no queue- spoke to a chap on reception who was utterly charming, who confirmed my ticket was valid and pointed me in the direction of the tour. Every single employee I encountered was bright, happy and helpful (and there are a lot of people who work there!).
The iconic building in all it's Art Deco magnificence is an absolute must see, the exhibition on the way up is informative and fun and of course the views of Manhattan and beyond are breathtaking. When I visited, there were less than 50 people on the observation deck. It was the highlight of my first trip to New York.",5.0,4.9364

6441,Skip the lines was bogus,"We paid double for skip all the lines. We had red carpet treatment at the ground floor and the waiting line for photos ($26). Nice to skip those lines. However, the line for the elevator to the 86th floor was very long. There was no red carpet because it winds through the narrow hallways. Same thing when it was time to come down from the 86th floor. Don't even think about paying for ""Skip all the lines"".",3.0,3.3062

6444,After 52 years I visited this emblematic building again!,"It was very exciting for me to return to this unique building after 52 years of my first visit, in 1967. I love of course the incredible views, but also the inside of the building. The only thing I didn't like is that too many people is aloud to enter at the same time, so it was not easy to enjoy the magnificence of the building and the views; actually, my wife and I had to leave before to enjoy parts of the views and other attractions, due to the multitude pressure.",4.0,2.2316000000000003

I had the privilege of seeing the sunset. I really recommend the visit.",4.0,4.71
6449,Empire State Building Revived,"So happy to see the rejuvenation of this Art Deco masterpiece.
The first and second floor historical introduction was just fun.
The voices and sounds of the construction workers back in 1929-30, the large mural sized photos, the almost life-size sculptures, made it all come back to life.
Taking the elevator up to the Observation Deck, it was fun to look at the ceiling at the projected film as though we were construction workers being hoisted up to a girder to work. Just fun.",5.0,4.9166
6450,Wonderful experience,"Visited on a fall evening. It was awesome seeing the city lit at night with a full moon and slightly cool breeze.

Definitely put it on your itinary when visiting the city.",5.0,4.8414
6454,SO amazing at night!,"I really enjoyed my trip to the Empire State building. My suggestion is to go at night, because the city lights will take your breath away!

6456,View is the great part of this but...,"You cannot deny the commanding view and historical feel at the top of this beautiful and noteworthy building. What I didn't like was the Disney experience of being ""managed"". Sure, you have to do something with the crowds and having so much eye candy along the way helps. It also made me feel like I was being sold to. It was yucky. At the end, if you don't go through the forbidding, dark Exit route, you get sent into an endless pathway through a gift shop that is unrelenting. I hate they took this iconic building and turned it into a genuine tourist trap.",3.0,2.8026

We did several observation decks while in town, but the Empire State Building is iconic, featured in too many movies to count, and that feeling of nostalgia hits you when you're here.

Can't wait to come back some day with my kids, they'll love it.",5.0,4.9239999999999995
6468,Worthwhile attraction,"It’s for sure pricey to take in this attraction however, you are in NY and it’s a must see.

6509,Expensive but worth it,"The Empire State Building is well-known around the world and I had the chance to discover why.

As soon as you see it, you recognise it: it might not be the tallest but it is still the most impressive in Manhattan.

But don't be impatient, since you will have to go through big queues (calculate at least 30min to an hour)

The ticket is pretty expensive (40USD the regular entrance, without professional pic in the photo call or activities or guide).

Once you have made it to the queues, you are taken to an elevator with a screen in the top that displays a video to entertain you during the 20-30 seconds that it will take you to make it to the top.

Then, you will be taken to the first stop. I can't remember which floor is it but it already has great views of the city.

As soon as you are done, another elevator and you arrive to the top of the building.

The views are stunning (not recommended for people that are not comfortable with heights), especially in a sunny day. You get to see all Manhattan, the statue of liberty in the distance, New Jersey...

It is a great experience that has to be lived at least once.",4.0,4.9834

6584,Iconic New York City,We went to the Empire State Building on September 1 around 6:30 pm. It was actually a perfect time to go as we wanted to see the views while it was still light out. We wanted to see the views at night so waited an hour at the top and saw it when the sun went down too. The views were very awesome and so iconic. There were not very many people here when we were there but we observed the empty stanchions where we only imagined how full it could be at peak periods. That would not be good and we walked forever before getting to the elevators to the top. It was around $150 for the 3 of us to go to the 86th floor. We think this was expensive but would not have missed it.,4.0,4.135
6585,Amazing,This is a must do! It is worth every penny. An iconic building in one of the great cities. And the view! Just do it.,5.0,4.5278
6586,Such an amazing view,"We had day & night tickets which is so great.
During the day very quick at the top. At night (after 2100) it was way to busy with long queues in the building before we were able to enjoy the fantastic view of all lights.
Personally I liked the view from Rockefeller more because then you have the wonderfull Empire State on your pictures ❤",5.0,4.8978
6587,Magnificent,"A must see in New York. Go early or late as the queus can be huge. We went at 10pm and didnt have to wait. Its an experience from the moment u step into the art deco building to the observation deck. The views are spectacular, seeing the city by night with all the lights is quite magical.",5.0,3.6364
6588,Old school icon,They really did great job getting to the essence of the building. Displays were awesome. The history of the building was told so well. Went with my grandson. Interactive displays were awesome.,5.0,4.8924
6589,ESB - 86th Floor,Staff was very friendly. Arrived for the visit on a Sunday morning and there was not much of a wait at all. The elevator ride to the top was quick and enjoyable. Visitors to the 86th floor can go to an outdoor observation deck. The experience could have had more guided tours or info presented from staff..,4.0,4.6032
6590,Awesome experience,"We decided to visit around 7pm and we found that there were no lines at this time, in fact myself and my friend were the only two in the elevator going up. Because it wasn’t too busy at this time there were excellent views and able to take some good photos. However it did start to get a lot busier as the sun was setting but wow! What a fantastic view it was at this time! We decided to stay up there until it went dark to get the full experience of seeing New York at night. It was very crowded up there by this time and the lines for the elevators to come back down were quite long, but well worth the experience.",5.0,4.9356
6591,Very tourist-oriented.,"I visited once before and it was a nice experience. I went to the top, looked around, and browsed a small gift shop. Now, you can only enter through a specific door and it’s overcrowded. There’s a lot of information to try to take in as you go through a giant maze to get to the elevators. They have the green screen photos for $30, too. When you finally get to the elevator it is very high tech, innovative and unique. I’m not sure if it was the holiday weekend, but there were far too many people on the observation deck. You could not even walk, we had to turn sideways and slide behind people to get through. You had to wait for a spot to get a picture because everyone was jammed up to the wall. Getting down was easier but they let you out through a huge gift shop that is like a maze that you must go through to get out! It felt like a tourist trap rather than an iconic building. They put in a lot of money and it is well done, I wouldn’t miss it, if you’ve never been. But I don’t recommend if it’s your second trip.",3.0,4.9502
6592,The only way to go,We bought the express (skip the line) tickets and that is the only way to go if you can afford it. We walked right in and went straight to the top. The tour is spectacular and the exhibits were amazing and the views were breathtaking.,5.0,4.7181999999999995

6596,Excellent observation deck experience,"This experience has changed since my last visit in 2008. The waiting area was nicely upgraded with lots to see and do while you wait. Excellent features, photos, exhibits, videos.... this was very well done. We were lucky to have Express tickets and also it was a very quiet labor Day weekend with little traffic... but we would have been well occupied if had to wait for a while.

There was plenty of room to check out the skyline from the observation deck. No elbowing or manuevering through the crowd to get a view. We were able to exit rather quickly as well.",5.0,4.702

Would encourage anyone visiting New York to experience this as it's one not to forget.,5.0,4.7804

6605,Amazing,Excellent visitor centre. Felt like we were actually on the building site of the building. Breathtaking views from the observatory. We went up at night.,5.0,4.6962
6606,Iconic building is worth the entrance fee,"Went yesterday in the middle of the day. There was no wait but plenty of people. It's a very well conceived display which I enjoyed much more than I had imagined. The view is spectacular, you will probably learn something (I did) and cleverly the experience is paced out so that you don't feel like you're just one of the 3.5 million who apparently visit each year. The staff in particular are exceptional in their special uniforms--with a smile and lively comment for everyone. It's a pricey activity but we came away happy--and I'd been very ambivalent as we stood outside to discuss whether to go up or not. Compared with the London Eye, for instance, this wins ""hands down"" (IMO).",5.0,4.9656
6607,This is definitely a must do in NY,"Loved this, more informative, fun and friendly then other observation decks. Loved the new King Kong exhibit. The view was definitely the best and I had a wheelchair that could go around every side of the observation deck which was not possible at others.",5.0,4.9402

Really great views of the NYC skyline!!",5.0,4.9272

6615,A Surprising Breath of Fresh Air,"I haven't been to the top of this building since 2 weeks before the tragic 9/11 events, so the skyline looked a bit different than I remembered it. However, the museum/building itself was awesomely updated with graphics and surprising visuals that I won't mention because I don't want to spoil any surprises. I thought they did a great job inside and once we reached the top it was a literal breath of fresh air compared to the trashy NYC streets. My sister stayed up there for much longer than we planned because the clean air felt so good. I highly recommend visiting this site if you haven't so in a while.",5.0,4.9128

6626,A Fantastic Experience,Allow 2 hrs for this visit. You start out going thru Airport like security (which is a great thing and makes you feel very safe) then you spend time walking thru the historical aspects of this amazing building. After that you take an elevator to an upper floor where you can look out various windows and then line up for final elevator ride up to the observation deck.

6664,Loved it!,"A long time ago, we just got on the elevator and went up to the observation deck... But now there is an amazing maze of corridors leading to the elevators, that display visual and written explanations about the history of the building and all the movies that featured this incredible building! I'm just sorry we were there on a cloudy day, but it was still worth it to see the view of NYC again!",5.0,4.6528

The building is gorgeous and history is artistically displayed throughout the tour. Old Glory on the observation deck and the view is breathtaking. Truly an experience to remember.",5.0,4.8952
6666,Probably a great view from the top but we didn't get to see it,"I almost feel guilty giving this attraction only 3 stars, I think we didn't see the best of it. We had a NY Pass which included access to the Observatory and as we were staying very close by we visited one evening. Unfortunately there were big queues down at the bottom of the lifts but once you get there, you're already in. Once we got to the top of the first lift we were then in another queue, which didn't move for ages and then went past a King Kong feature, which was nice. Once we got to the real observation deck we found out why we had been queuing for so long. Because there was some lightning outside the outside decks were closed and we think that the delays were due to getting everyone inside. As a result, we could go to the inside observation decks but nothing else and it felt a real anti-climax. I think we were just unlucky on this occasion and we saw the building towering over Midtown every day but I can only rate it as we found it, and that was disappointing on this occasion.",3.0,2.7556
6667,On top of NY,What a cool view. The open air observation deck is a busy place but well worth going to. We also went to the higher closed in observation floor. Very pricey but we all enjoyed seeing just how big NYC really is.,5.0,4.7558

6669,Awesome view,"Best time to visit between 8:30-9:30 am. Would recommend online booking to cut the queue. Otherwise, 20-30 minutes waiting time is expected. Going up the viewing deck is another queue but a guard will give the option for those who will be willing to climb up 7floors or wait for the elevator service. Mostly would opt to climb the steps thereby drastically cutting the waiting time for those opting for elevator service.. view is fantastic, souvenir shop available and a mini store is open for a quick snack and drinks. Highly recommended.",5.0,4.7242
6670,A Must Do,Was expecting queues but didn't get any which was a bonus. Great views and well organised. We went around 10 am and walked straight in. Was busy at top so had to wait for good viewing points in certain areas but not long. Whole attraction was lot faster than we expected.,5.0,4.9356

6680,VIP Premium with Gerard Was Fantastic,"We had our VIP Premium experience on September 2, 2019, with Gerard, and it was great. The tour promptly started at 5:30 PM, as scheduled. We saw the ""celebrity wing,"" learned about the history of the ESB from its design inception to its grand opening to current day, and, once on the 86th floor, was told of the evolution of the island of Manhattan including the latest development that is Hudson Yard.

The ability to bypass queues aside, I most enjoyed the degree of enthusiasm, personalization, and knowledge with which Gerard spoke about the ESB. He looked and sounded as if he genuinely enjoyed and took pride in what he did, and that, in turn, made me want to listen, engage, and ask questions enriching my own experience.

The only drawback for me is that the 102th floor was under renovation when we visited. Perhaps the information was on the official booking website when I purchased the tickets, but I did not see it and certainly wish I had experienced the 102th floor.

$175.00 per person, inclusive of tax, was certainly a little expensive, but I would not have gone with a different type of tour and certainly would recommend VIP Premium to those who would appreciate the history of an architectural icon in more personalized setting.",5.0,4.9812
6681,Night time up the Empire,Great trip up the Empire State Building late at night no que straight up to the to the top I likedthe new route up tho,5.0,4.3616
6682,Too expensive to go to the very top,This was my second time going up the Empire State Building. Albeit some 20 years apart. We accessed it as part of our NY citypass which gives 5 attractions. It was great to do but the citypass only provided entry to the observatory. You can go some 19 stories higher into the spire but at USD45 per person we thought that was a bit rich.,4.0,4.7074
6683,Awsome view,Worth every penny of it to go up and enjoy the skyline scrappers of New York city. Along the way you will enjoy the video of building the Empire state building and old clips of King Kong and other movies shot here.

6693,Beautiful Views,"The whole process was a bit un organised in my opinion, their was like 1 or 2 nice staff, that was the door man and the women who said thanks for visiting as we was leaving. but the rest of the staff seemed to have a bit of a attitude or just didn’t look like they wanted to help. Which made us feel unwelcome and abit in easy. Had one man not showing us correctly how to exit and as we was stud confused he just raised his voice telling us to move on. Which we had no clue where we was going. So that was abit embarrassing and unhelpful. But from all that we enjoyed it and was an amazing experience. Definitely a site worth seeing. King Kong effects before you head up to the views were amazing, really blew me back! And for the views. Breath taking! Definitely would go back for the views again but hopefully next time there’s nicer staff!",5.0,4.9784

The sky was clear and it was warm, but once up at the top it was quite windy and a little chilly. If you go in the Winter i would definitely recommend wrapping up, as we went in the Summer.

Although it was still very busy at the observation decks, but that's okay because then you are already at the top :-) And the second was that we could watch sunset. Well, since it was too cloudy, no real sunset, but we could see the city first by daylight and then one by one (actually hundreds by hundreds) the lights went on in the skyscrapers and after an hour the sky was dark and we could see New York by night!",5.0,4.8318

6742,The Best Views!,"The Empire State Building may not be the tallest building in NYC anymore, but it sure has one of the best observation decks in the city (if not, THE best, but I can't say for sure because I haven't been up in every skyscraper). What's great about it is that the viewing area is outside the main building on a deck that allows you to feel the weather and to see the views below unobstructed by windows. This means you can also take pictures without shooting through glass or bars. You do have to work your way through other viewers to spots where you can hold your phone or camera for the shot, but it's doable, even when it's crowded. The museum-like hallways that lead you to the elevators to go up to the top are also worth a look--leave time so you don't have to just run by them. They show interesting history and photography of the building.",5.0,4.9728
6743,A must do - New York History,"This is likely the most famous building in the world.

This was part of our New York Pass.

We went up at night about 8 PM on a week night. The total wait between ticket, security, and elevator was about 15 minutes.

We did not have any issues at security and were able to bring water bottles.

The view is incredible to say the least. Not as far north a Top of the Rock. Not as far South as One world trade. But definitely the most famous and historic.

When you get all the way up walk up stairs as high as you can go. Better picture taking from open air.

Important to go when weather is clear.",5.0,4.8826
6744,Very crowded,I gave an excellent rating only because the staff was very nice and there was cool exhibits but once we got to the top it was so crowded we could barely walk/see. Everyone was very rude and wouldn’t scoot even a little so we could get a nice a picture. But that isn’t the Empire State Building fault. Early this year we went to top of the rock at the Rockefeller center and there was so much more room once you get to the top and just as great of a view. But I still recommend for the experience,5.0,4.8806

6752,Don’t Rush Through To the Elevator!,"Something for which I am kicking myself is that we rushed through the history presentation in our haste to get to the view. The information about the ESB was actually amazing, so control your panic and enjoy the information - the view will still be there, and it won’t be any more crowded than when you first passed through the turnstiles.

Otherwise, the view is, of course, incredible, but so too are the staff who work there. Almost to a person they were helpful, friendly, welcoming and charming. Our favourite was Renita, who went out of her way to take a nice photo of my partner and myself.

Two more things: Firstly, don’t be fooled: there is nothing overrated about this experience, though we only paid for a single entry pass.
Secondly, get there about 25 minutes before it opens and you will probably be first in line. The tourist hordes arrive between 9 and 10am.",5.0,4.9328

The ride up the elevators is fun with little nuggets of interesting information strewn along the way.
It is a little overpriced for what is exactly on offer, but that is probably a NYC thing!",4.0,4.0408

6760,Easy to Access and So Enjoyable,I avoided visiting this attraction during my 20 years as a NYC resident. Thought it would be crowded and underwhelming. I was so wrong! I visited at 3pm on a Thursday and breezed to the top. There are very informative exhibits that tell the story of its construction and I learned a lot.

I visited on the last Sunday of August, around 4-5pm and I was up on the viewing deck within about 15 minutes. The staff were very nice, very polite and efficient, and the views were out of this world. Loved every second of it. There was no limit to the time you got there either, just walk around in your own time. Couldn't fault the attraction itself, however the only thing that let it down was the gift shop. Very overpriced and not much that I'd actually want if I'm honest. I was itching to buy something but walked out with nothing. Such a shame.",5.0,4.9338

However, although we visited it in the morning, and the queue at the entrance was quite short, the observatory itself was pretty crowded and we felt kind of uncomfortable.

We were in the height of tourist season so got to the building for 8:15 in the morning just after it opened. We walked straight in and straight into the lifts to go up. We spent 1/2 hr up the top with just a few other people. When we left at around 9 the observatory bit was getting rather full and people were waiting to get to the ‘edge’.

I enjoyed seeing buildings (like the Flatiron) which I wasn't sure that I would be able to get to later. We all had some initial nervousness with being so high, but it dissipated.
The ""retro"" feel (e.g. the ushers all wore 30s era uniforms) to the building, coupled with its size gives it a different ambiance that other buildings in Manhattan (like Rockefeller Plaza) did not have (in my opinion).",4.0,3.2926

Tickets were expensive and while the views were great the the top, there was a crowd 3 people deep around the whole observation deck at 8pm. This made the experience stressful as trying to move and keep with your group was difficult.

I went in the daytime, and think a nighttime visit would be awesome. This attraction lost one star due to the price. Adult ticket is $43 when tax is added.

6825,Surprised and delighted!,"My family was not initially planning to visit the ESB on our recent trip to NYC and we would have missed it entirely except that my 17-year-old expressed an interest in seeing the iconic building. I had been to the observation deck myself in ‘89 and again in ‘94. Though I enjoyed the visits I personally felt I had seen what there was to see and could forego the $40+ ticket price to see it again. Luckily upon arrival, my family spontaneously decided to go up and we promptly bought tickets. I’m happy to report that the experience was quite fulfilling, there were interactive displays on the way to the elevator that relayed relevant facts and anecdotal information about the building process of the ESB as well as what measures had been taken to make the landmark much more energy efficient. Fun too, were the celebrity photos of visitors to the site and the list of popular move and TV shows that featured the building. There’s also a cool interactive video set that allows visitors to get photos of themselves being captured by King Kong. We accidentally arrived at the observation deck as the sun was setting, little realizing that it is the absolute BEST time to see the city from that vantage point! When all was done, we exited through the gift shop and found that there are many decent souvenirs to purchase. The whole experience was well worth the time and ticket price for our family.",5.0,4.977

6849,Just what you’d expect and a little bit more,"It has all the usual hype to make you spend money - photos against a green screen etc, but the lift ride up was fun with a screen in the roof looking like you were breaking through the roof. There were lots of facts and displays on how it was built which were interesting and fun, and animated screens showing the riveters building the frame. With an animated King Kong trying to get through the windows, it made the experience exciting for the whole family. The views were amazing, though I didn’t like the wire fencing everywhere (but I understand why it’s needed). Cheaper than the Rockefeller Centre.",5.0,4.9681999999999995

We went mid afternoon with explorer passes and went straight in, no more than 2 minutes queuing. Spent a good 90 minutes there and enjoyed every minute. Not just the observation deck but looking at the pictures before and during the construction in 1931.

I managed to look out over New York with my back pinned against the inside wall but it was amazing - you cannot beat views like that!

6903,Choose your time wisely,"We took our two teens to NYC for a long weekend. They had never been there before, and were really excited to go up into the Empire State Building and take photos of the city. Well, we got delayed in our plans, and ended up not going up until after 7:00pm. It was obnoxiously packed...we hadn't taken into account that it was time for the sunset! My kids are not tall, and we had to coach them to be firm and assertive, but not rude, so that they would be able to take some photos. Some people are so incredibly rude...they would be right up front, refusing to budge while they just stood there, gazing at the city, sometimes not even taking photos. I get it...sometimes it is nice to just relax; you don't always need photos, but at 13 and 14, my kids wanted pics, as do most people who pay that much money to go up to the observation deck. One extremely rude family stood four across, EACH of them with a camera, taking photo after photo, and the daughter was taking a freaking TIME LAPSE video of the sunset. My daughter politely tapped the mom on the shoulder and asked to be able to take a photo; the woman responded, in heavily accented English, that she would allow her to ""take ONE photo; just ONE!"" When my daughter got up there, I instructed her to take as many photos as she wanted.",4.0,4.6328
6904,Such a great time!,"It’s really cool that the journey up the ESB is no longer not just the elevator up the building and the view, but also a cool multimedia experience! It’s worth it: try it out. Hope the trip up to the 102nd floor is soon open again. I am told that will happen in October.",5.0,4.7546
6905,Very much worth it at sunset,"Writing this review for the two “scared of heights” people in our group. The elevator to 79th Floor has a cool ceiling animation and soundtrack to distract you. This brings you to an enclosed section - you don’t have to get close to the edge of you don’t want to. There is then another short lift to the 86th floor. When you alight you are not immediately outside, so you can get acclimatised. Go outside if you want, or stay inside. It is so beautiful. Do it - you’ll feel such a sense of achievement!",5.0,4.5792

6908,Tuesday morning visit,Be looking forward to doing this for years. And wow what a fantastic experience. We dropped on with no queues. Straight in . Took our time to see the whole exhibition. Then got in the lifts to the top and all I can say is mind blowing. Truly wonderful experience.,5.0,4.8764
6909,"If you haven't been in a while, go again!","Last time I was at the Empire State Building was probably 15 years ago. This time, it felt completely different. the Museum portion in the lower floors was outstanding, outlining the history and construction of the building with lots of colorful and interactive displays. My 8 year old loved it! I wish we had spent more time in this portion but were in a rush to get to the top. So enjoy it while you are there because there is no option to go through the museum again after you've started to go up to the top.

We purchased skip-the-line tickets and they were well worth it, even on a relatively cloudy and moderately busy day. We had our own elevator for most of the trip upstairs and didn't wait in any lines at all.

I do wish, however, that there had been benefits for skip-the-line going back DOWN afterward, but this was a minor thing.

What can I say about the view? Absolutely amazing in every direction. Lots of places to get a close up view of specific sights and overall, just breathtaking. This is 100% a must-do in NYC and it can make you forget all of the craziness of the world below you.

The gift show was enormous, almost obnoxiously so. The photos they took at the beginning and picked up at the end were awesome, and I don't think we ran into even a single staff member who was anything less than pleasant.

Thanks to the Empire State Building staff for making this such a memorable experience.",5.0,4.9832
6910,Stunning Views - an obvious must do in NYC,"The views are incredible and not to be missed on any trip to the Big Apple. We went just before sunset and as expected it was packed. You had to queue to get to the front and take photos. Some people have planted themselves at the front and won’t move. It was spectacular nonetheless, so I would go at sunset again as you’re able to see day and night views in one. It is very very busy though. The museum part is impressive too so take your time to view that before heading to the top. Keep in mind there is a wait for the elevator but we took the 7 flights of stairs instead to reach the 86th floor.",5.0,3.9686

My mother who loves architecture enjoyed it very much too, despite not speaking English fluently so it's great for those as well who can't read every description. The elevator ride was smooth, well-organized(despite the omnipresent crowds) and the view is still incredible.",5.0,4.9328
6913,Most Iconic Building in NYC,If it’s your first visit to NYC a tour of the Empire State Building is a must! Skip the Line saved us about a 1/2 hour of standing in line but it wasn’t busy at all - I could see that during a busy time period it would really save someone some time. The exhibit itself is really neat - something very like a theme park. Outside on the observation deck - the views are worth the trip up!,5.0,4.913

We went at dusk which made it even cooler as everything twinkled.,5.0,4.7726
6921,Awesome view of NYC,"The 360° view of NYC from top is awesome but unfortunately it started raining when we reached to top. We were able to take few photos as we had umbrellas but others were not so lucky and had to wait.

6938,They have really upped the experience,"I visited the Empire State building several years ago. The only reason I went again was because my toddler wanted. When I saw the prices, I couldn’t believe how high they were. But they have really changed things in the last few years. Although the line was very long, you go through a lot of different experiences along the way. You can spend some time learning about the construction of the building, its history in movies and TV, and all of the celebrities that have visited. There’s a great little area with King Kong. The elevator to the 79th floor has a screen on the roof of the elevator that makes it look like they are constructing the building as you are traveling upward. As you snake through the line on the 79th floor, you get to look out the windows to get a preview of what you’ll see upstairs. You can skip the line and walk up, if you choose. Once you get up to 86, you can walk around the outside. Then you take the elevators back down, and of course you end up in the gift shop.",5.0,4.7694

They've changed a lot of the line process since we last saw it in the early 00's; they seem to handle crowds well, and there is a lot of history in the line queue to see and read. It's a bit expensive, though compared to other buildings, seems on par (in the early 00's, it was only $4 to got to the 86th floor!); Overall, it's a must-see, it's not a 5-star simply because the cost to view is outrageous.",4.0,4.2228

My wife and I had visited the site before we even had kids and the experience this time made the visit so informative and entertaining that even the grandchildren thoroughly enjoyed the visit.",5.0,4.759
6944,Nice view from historical building in NYC,"The WTC may be higher but the Empire State Building is iconic and has a lot of history. Personally, I prefer the open air view of the Empire State Building as compared to the World Trade Center where you are in sealed glass. When I first did this, you paid a few dollars to go up the elevator to the observatory, now you pay $40 for a tourist attraction. The displays are nice, but the only real reason to go is for the view. Would give it five stars if it were (as it used to be) a better value for the money - now it is something that you do once (or take your kids once) and likely don't do it again (at least for a long time) given you will spend over $100 to take the family to the top of a building.",4.0,4.891

With so many options in NYC The Empire State Building never disappoints. Roomiest observatory and best 360 view of the city. That building is why NYC is NYC. Additionally, it's extremely kid friendly and I can't say that about most of the other observatory tours. To the staff, thanks again for all the hard work you all do. It makes a difference as to how NYC is perceived and the country as a whole.

6946,"Beautiful view, but much too crowded","Please, could you limit the number of people on the deck? We booked fast lane tickets. With these we were able to skip the line for the first elevator which was fine. But then we had to line up for the security check and the second elevator to the highest platform. While we were waiting in this line the sun was setting and we could not see anything. When we finally got outside on the platform it was so crowded that we had to stand in third or fourth row behind the fence so that we could not see much either. Also, we had the feeling we could not breathe any fresh air because it was so crowded.
I would appreciate if you could pre-book your time for access to the viewing platform like on Top of the Rock.
The view, if you are able to see it, is beautiful.",2.0,4.9208
6947,Wonderful and worth it,Amazed at how this visit has come on in 20 yrs (my last visit). Much more to look at and liked the construction workers video and King Kong. And the lift shaft!!! Great views and worth the money. Well done for adding to it ESB!,5.0,4.8713999999999995

6951,Great night view of the city’s skyline,"Arrived on Wednesday evening a bit after sunset. Took a few minutes to find the building’s entrance (as the Uber driver dropped us by the exit), and then everything went quite smoothly.

Once you pass the initial queue people are hearded in like cattle. Its hot and people are elbow to elbow. People that came in after us were able to get passed us, too. There was about 45 minutes of this (only 45 minutes because ""it was slow""). I was just counting thousands of dollars spent all around me as my family and I, along with many other families, are uncomfortably squeezing throught these rooms to get to the elevators. How about add some ropes with the money that two people spend to get in there, huh? The view was great once we were up top, but we wouldv'e left if we hadn't already paid. It was one of the most clostrophobic situations I've ever been in.",2.0,3.862

6985,Worst part of our New York Trip,"Worst visit during our trip. Overcrowded, too much money, and rude staff. Couldn't take a good pic. This should be a historical monument, but it has turned into a carnival attraction. You get herded like cattle through long lines and when you get to the top area, there are so many people crammed in like a cattle car that you cannot even get a descent picture of the skyline because no one will move aside. Poor visitor management on the part of the staff. I know money needs to be generated, but at what cost? If people can't enjoy the tour, bad reviews mean less tourist. I for one would wait, like we have to for the Statue of Liberty, or make reservations to have an enjoyable tour, rather than feel I have wasted my time trying to enjoy what should be one of the most significant buildings in Manhattan.",1.0,2.4548

6987,A must see when visiting New York,"This was our second visit and there have been some improvements to the entrance which meant that we didn’t have to wait long to get up to the Observatory. The addition of the photo opportunity of the Empire State Building was also a bonus.
The views are fantastic and I feel safe at the top whereas the Rockerfeller was a bit scary for me! I was able to relax and look out over the wonderful views.
Take time to read about the building before you go outside it’s so interesting! King Kong area was fabulous and a great photo opportunity!
The decor of this building is sympathetic to its roots of Art Deco and I am so pleased to see this being maintained when redecorated. It was nice to see the old entrance on our way out too as this is a beautiful lobby that takes your breath away.
Thank you to Mr Jean-Yves Ghazi for offering some information and his time on our way out of the building - a very nice personal touch which I was very impressed with seeing that he is the President in the Company.
I will return and will go say hi to King Kong and Mr Ghazi!!
I would highly recommend this tourist attraction at any time of the day or night 😀",5.0,4.9922

6989,Spectacular Midnight view of NYC,"Last minute decision to go up the Empire State whilst in New York. The kids decided they’d like to see the city at night after we went up one world observatory a couple of days previously in the day time.
It was after midnight when we got there and no queuing at the ticket machines and a small queue to get into the elevator to go up. There were a few people up on the viewing deck but it wasn’t packed and uncomfortable. The views out over the city on all directions were immense. A clear sky and no mist meant we could see as far as the eye could see. The fence allowed me to use my camera without getting those bloody awful reflections of the person behind you and I got some belter photos.
The info in the lead up to the elevator was interesting and there was a great photo opportunity with king kongs hand coming through the wall.
It’s a beautiful building and the architecture meant that it was much nicer than going to the top of the rock and looking at the empire from a distance.
On the whole an absolute top banana of an idea to go at this time. Make sure it’s not misty or foggy though it might reduce visibility.
Highly recommended.",5.0,4.9742

The tower has a panoramic view to all of the city and on the way up their is a short movie. Before coming to the elevators there is a museum that explains about the building and were it is referenced. The building is a great way to teach young children about the building and places in new york.",5.0,4.569
6992,Great NYC Skyline,I've always wanted to see the Empire State building and it did not disappoint. I purchased the VIP tickets for the 86th and 102nd floor (bit more expensive) but after reading about reviews of wait times I did not want to spend part of my trip waiting in a long line up to get in. I wanted to come a bit before the sun was setting so I could get pictures of both regular time and sun rise. Spent the sunrise on the 102nd which I recommend. It can be a bit crowded up there as it is smaller so you may have to go up early. When we arrived there was a long line up for people with regular tickets and security can take some times. I got so many pictures and I am so happy I came here for a visit. It is a must see if you come to NYC!,5.0,4.9044
6993,Great experience for the price,"This is definitely a must-do for anyone visiting New York. Got some amazing pictures with incredible views and was just a great experience. Totally worth the money.

6994,Morning on the observation deck,"Spent over an hour on the observation deck looking out over New York city - a truly unique view! We went early in the morning to beat the lines. Still had to wait a little bit but it was not nearly as bad as later in the day. The first elevator takes you to the 80th floor where there is a museum type exhibit to walk through. Then to the deck. Tickets are not cheap (over $40 each for the standard day / night admissions) but for us, this will probably be our only trip to the building so it was worth the cost!",4.0,4.6848

6996,Still the best place to see NYC skyline,"With competition growing (Rockefeller, 9/11) the Empire State Building stays our favorite. New attractions, photo-exhibitions and videos complete the unique experience leading up to the observatory. The later is indeed crowded but the 'way up' is relatively painless (it took us less than 45 mins from buying tickets to standing on observatory). Was it a good-luck day? Maybe. Yet it was mid August, with beautiful weather and early afternoon when we went...",4.0,4.8162
6997,Worth the hype,"Iconic is the best way to describe this building. Of all the places I wanted to see in New York, this was at the top of my list and it didn’t disappoint. From the moment you go in, the lift up to the first stage with all the information about the building and the views to the top viewing platform. It was fantastic. We spent ages up there and so did everyone else. They have the ticket quantity just right, it was busy but not too crowded. The views across the whole of Manhattan were fantastic. There maybe taller buildings but none as good as this. I recommend this to everyone.",5.0,4.7434
6998,Wonderful,"The Empire State Building never disappoints - always a wonderful experience. This was the first time we took the kids and they all loved it. Of course the kids felt that they knew the building having seen it on so many films. We went relatively early in the morning, walking through Bryant Park from our hotel. Seeing the building from the ground is great, but going up to the viewing area is even better. The views across NYC are exceptional. The staff are so courteous (and their smart uniforms add to the occasion). All in all a lovely family experience.",5.0,4.9504
6999,Atop of the city,"The ESB is probably the most visited monument in NYC. Despite not being the highest building in the city its fame has converted it into a ""must-go"". Unfortunately for me some parts of the building were closed due to rehab work so as the 102 floor. Never mind, the sights from floor 86 are incredible. The fact that outside there is only an iron grid to protect from falling and the wind blows into one's face makes the sensation of being so high more real. Even more than the terraces at Top of the Rock and the Observatory at One World Trade Center. And moreover, the binoculars are for free!",5.0,4.2951999999999995
7000,Top of the world,It was about 7pm on a Tuesday night. We thought we would have to wait a long time to get to the observation deck. We only waited a out 20 mins to reach the top.

7005,Sunrise Experience at Empire State Building,"This VIP experience is well worth the extra money. Looking at the reviews of a regular ESB ticket, the most common lament is the wait times and crowds once inside. The sunrise experience skips the lines and you pretty much have the whole observation deck to yourself. I'll gladly pay double to avoid all the riff raff. We were greeted promptly at the entrance at the time posted on our ticket (5:30 AM in mid-August). The woman who greeted us was lovely. We had a few minutes to check out the lobby and take pictures. Passed through security quickly and we were up on the observation deck by 5:45 AM. Only snag was that it was cloudy so we didn't get a perfect shot of the sunrise. We still got some great photos though as the city transitioned from darkness to light. Very cool to see this change in a matter of an hour. Here's the kicker - because we didn't get the true sunrise experience they gave us skip the line passes to return at a later time (tickets are good for a year). In all, highly recommended!",5.0,4.9366
7006,Great!,We had Empire State Building as part of our City Pass whilst in New York and it was great. Just scan the city pass and entry is easy. The interactive exhibits and images before going up and really interesting. Being afraid of heights I stayed inside the observation deck once on the 86th floor whilst my husband went to the outside deck. I was happy that they gave the option of a large inside viewing deck. Lofts up and down were fast and it was a great view!,5.0,4.9178

It's a bit sunny up there, so be sure to bring sunglasses and maybe a hat if you are fair skinned like me. The VIP skip-the-line ticket is totally worth the extra money!!! We didn't have to get there as soon as it opened, and we arrived around 11am. Both on the way up, and especially on the way down, you have to wait for several different elevators to get all the way to the observation deck. Without the express ticket, it appears that the wait for the elevator down is much longer than on the way up. Definitely spring for the express ticket! :-)",4.0,4.9574

7012,Open Up The 102 Floor!,"This years trip to the Empire State Building was not as great as last year. The continuing renovations have kept the 102 level closed. It was supposed to have opened by the end of June, then by the end of July...well, still closed. We paid for 5 skip the line tickets. Very expensive, but to me worth it. Quick up, no lines at all. Beautiful nighttime views. There is a museum of sorts there now, part of the new renovations, this was nice. Miss the old original entrance though that had the raised art deco relief of the building. So classic and so much a part of the building. Now you enter through a blah blah blah could be any other tourist building entrance. Not an improvement. So, all in all, could have passed up this visit. You only go now because of the history of the building, and to see the building where King Kong climbed, where Lucy and Ethel carried out a harebrained scheme dressed as aliens. But for experience, for views? Go instead to the freedom Tower in lower Manhattan, so much better.",4.0,4.9018

I enjoyed how they made you feel like part of history, present during the building process and interactive. Loved the King Kong attraction. Beautiful view of the city from the 86th floor. Watched the sunset. The staff were friendly and knowledgeable. All around a great experience for my husband and I.",5.0,4.9806

7022,NYC with the kids,"I’d been here many times before dating almost 10 years back. I was surprisingly impressed. My memory was of at least an hour wait in long line. However, they have now added a very informative and entertaining museum of sorts that makes the wait more than tolerable. If any of the porters asks if u want to take stairs, jump at it. It gets u out of a long line and makes u feel better about that pastrami sandwich u ate earlier in the day.",4.0,4.785
7023,Early morning visit,"A must do if you’re in NYC.

We arrived between 0900-1000 and were able to go up to the viewing tower without any significant queuing.

7024,Nice place to go if your in the area,I visited both the Empire State Building and the One World Trade Center. Both are good places to go. I would go to whichever is closest to you. One big difference between the two places is that you can actually go outside when you’re up in the Empire State Building. The One World Trade Center doesn’t have an outside area. It’s completely behind glass.,5.0,3.8808

7026,"For $50, it was cool-ish. Little over priced","I decided to visit the Empire State Building (as no Trip to NY would be complete without one). It was confusing to get to at first but got to go buy my tickets for it. However, the tickets were pricey for the highest view of NYC. Still, it was great out and got to take some pics.",3.0,4.3616
7027,Empire State Building,It was a beautiful view! Loved seeing the history of the building. No need to buy the more expensive pass to skip the line. We were there when it opened the line was short. Must see in New York!!,4.0,4.6328

7029,Such a story,Really enjoyed the information about the people and timeline of the Empire State Building construction.Crazy to see people that high in the sky like nothing is going on. Day we visited was a little foggy but still worth the trip.,4.0,4.3186

7033,No wait,"I was so glad that I read reviews before booking tickets because most comments said the extra money for the go ahead pass wasn't necessary. We arrived about 8:30 pm and waited only about 5 minutes to go in. So glad I didn't pay double the amount for the go ahead pass!! Very nice view at dusk, lots of people so sometimes hard to get good pictures.",5.0,4.8386

The sensational view, well executed security and time allowed to stay on the observation deck as long as you want, is priceless. See some visitors, even packing some liter snacks and of course the many proposals. My clients always amazed at there scope of the vista- magnificent and we (NYC)- have it!!!!",5.0,4.8392
7036,Good for people who love heights,"This will be a quick review... the price of the ticket I found quite pricy , not to mention the fact that you had to wait endlessly for an elevator and at some point we were asked to use the stairs.

Oh when at the top you have a nice view of Newyork, and to tell you the truth, in 10 minutes most people just take pictures and go back down.

It was nice because I always wanted to visit this place and well It was quite quick.

Cheers.",4.0,4.8426
7037,Empire State Building,Visited the Empire State Building on a Friday afternoon in August. Almost no queues and very quickly made it up to the viewing platform.

7042,"I'm so glad I did it, despite my fear of heights!","I have a really hard time with heights. Really hard. But I also like to challenge myself when I can. So my husband wanted to go to the top of the Empire State Building when we visted NY for his birthday in February, so I agreed to go up with him. Thankfully the attendants inside were all very nice and answered all my nervous questions about the length of the elevator rides, how many elevators, the conditions up top, etc. The rest was like a well-oiled machine. They tell you where to go. They tell you when to get on the elevator, where to switch elevators, and when you do get to the top there is an ""inside"" waiting area for those that might not want to go to the outside observation deck. Luckily the day I went the crowds were lighter than usual, so the crowds on the outside observation area weren't too obnoxiously large. :) Oh, and they play a really neat video on the ceiling of the elevators when you ride up. I wasn't expecting that, and it was such a fun addition to the visit!",5.0,4.986
7043,"Trip to the Top, Worth It!","Visited this New York City icon for the first time and was not disappointed. It’s pretty expensive but you won’t find a better view. It’s beautiful and impressive. You get your tickets and head up the lower inside observation deck, which is pretty good. There’s a bunch of videos and information about the history and construction of the building, but nothing in depth. You then go to the actual outdoor observation area and it is impressive. You can view it from all sides. It’s obviously crowded since it’s a big tourist trap but felt pretty safe and is well managed. You’ll spend about 30-60 minutes there. Staff were all friendly and professional. It’s worth the price for such an amazing view.",5.0,4.9686
7044,Awesome,Wonderful views and exhilarating experience. Thought the photos they take of you and then try to sell are too pricey,5.0,4.5012
7045,Nice view,"We went around 2pm and there were no lines. We walked right up and got on the next elevator. You can tell the walk up to the elevators were setup for LONG waits with a lot to see, read, and watch.
The view was exciting.",4.0,3.5
7046,Don’t visit in August!,"Avoid visiting in August! So crowded that you couldn’t see anything because of all the other people around you! Pretty claustrophobic. Numbers should be limited to make it a more pleasurable experience rather than just being jostled in a huge mass of bodies! You literally had seconds to take a quick picture, then you had to move to let others see the view.

Shame really, because we last visited here in April (2016) and loved it so much that we booked to go again, but it really was far too crowded this time.

The views are stunning & watching the sun go down and the lights come on over Manhattan is spectacular, but go in the Springtime 😊",3.0,4.6564
7047,Good time up ESB,"Did not have express - but we went early and was on 86 floor in no time - 20 minutes or so. Stayed up top for a good hour or so taking in the impressive views. Tickets are a bit pricey but this was a must do for us - so glad I paid the price for a great morning in this iconic landmark. Really nice gift shop too, I had to be evicted by the wife to stop me going over 90 dollars...",5.0,4.9538
7048,NYC from Above,You can enjoy the big pictures when you enter the building. You are expected to see NYc from above if the weather allows it otherwise you will see fog and forming of clouds.,5.0,3.9878
7049,Our family loved the new 2nd Floor museum as much as the view,We live in NYC and always bring visiting friends & family to the Empire State Building. It always impresses but this time we got to experience the new museum on the 2nd floor. It’s included in the ticket price at no extra charge and adds about 30 minutes to the visit. We found it educational and entertaining. I think the family enjoyed it as much as the view. Seeing King Kong was a highlight and our pics came out amazing. If you’ve already been you need to go back to see this fantastic new attraction.,5.0,4.9662
7050,Just wow,"Go at night if you have young children, it's more appealing and beautiful and the staff run things very smoothly and stress free",5.0,4.3194
7051,Amazing,I have been to New York many times and was always afraid 😱 to go up the Empire State Building because it was so high but this year I promised myself I would it and it was amazing 😉 to see this city in all its glory I loved it and so well organized I would recommend it to anyone.,5.0,4.9614
7052,Excellent - miles better than One Workd Teade Center,"On this family trip we visited both the Empire State Building and the new One World Trade Center (Freedom Tower). Although the Empire State has long ago lost its title as the world’s tallest building, and One World Trade Center dwarfs it as the highest in the Western Hemisphere (but outranked by structures in Malaysia and the UAE), the Empire State is much better. The views are better - it’s actually nicer to be a bit closer to the ground! - you can go out into the open air (unlike OWTC where you are hemmed in by glass), and you get a great sight of downtown (including OWTC!), Liberty Island, midtown with the Chrysler Building, and Central Park.
Also unlike OWTC, you don’t feel yourself hustled by relentless commercial exploitation. Like all high-rise observation platforms it’s not cheap but you’re allowed to enjoy it once you’ve paid the entrance price.
We went on a Friday evening just before sunset and stayed nearly three hours so that we could see the views by day and by night. It was magical. It was also crowded - allow an hour for queuing. It’s well worth it.",5.0,4.928
7053,What a view! Great at night!,"We visited the empire state building around 9:30pm thinking it would be a little quieter but boy was we wrong, we queued for around 20 minuets for the first elevator and around another 20 minutes for the next elevator that took us too the top...although we had a around a 40 minute wait the view made up for this! looking over New York at night is truly beautiful and I would recommend this to any one visiting New York",5.0,4.7244

If you put history to one side however, is only slightly overshadowed by One World Observatory for overall experience.",4.0,3.0

7057,Great historic attraction,"The VIP tour at the Empire State building needs to be on your bucket list if it isn’t already. For me this was educational and awe inspiring. From the old school uniforms, educational, informative and historic pictures and the views, this was awesome. If you’re afraid of heights maybe not so much of a good idea.
You really should go and take it all in with your significant other. It’s worth the money and you won’t be sorry. Make sure you go all the way up to the 102nd floor.",5.0,4.9142
7058,Day visit,Thoroughly enjoyed our visit. We did this during the day and did the Rock Observatory in the evening. Both were absolutely fantastic.,5.0,4.6338
7059,Great views,Went early in the morning (pretty much as it opened) so didn’t have a problem with any queues. Booked in advance. Last time I went was in 2001 and you got to go in the original Art Deco elevator. A shame you don’t do that any more as they’ve modernised everything for security etc. Beautiful views.,4.0,3.7374
7060,Historical Significance Worth It,"My daughter has been to Top of the Rock twice and wanted to go again. I forced her into going to the Empire State Building and she loved it.

7063,"Empire State, tricks of the trade!","One of the most iconic buildings in New York, America or even the world! After reading trip advisor some of the comments were around having to wait in line or even the price. (Thank you to you guys!)

This is a must visit but here are my tips:

1- go early- we went just before opening time. It allowed us to miss the foot traffic, skip the line and enjoy it. We went for opening time and there was no line, we went to the top and had key points shown to us by the staff- vip experience Without the price tag!

2- New York pass- in the past we have visited other places and the pass hasn’t been worth it. We stayed for 5 nights and got 3 days of pass meaning after Empire State we did the bus tour! Busy but a day to remember the pass is really worth it for visitors to the area.

3- I know It’s not strictly ESB but because we got there early we got breakfast sandwiches from a little deli shop opposite, affordable and convenient, also meant we stayed in the attraction a little longer, worth a thought!

Ok now my tips are over onto the review (I get some people may stop reading here and I wouldn’t be offended but here goes)

Key points of the Empire State Building:

1- friendly staff- let us in early, made us smile and incredibly knowledgable. Their company should be proud of them.

2- There’s only 1! Whilst we were up there the skyline was amazing and lots of staff to tell you about the scenery. A must visit. It was a little strange as usually a picture of New York isn’t complete without Seeing the building in it, probably the only place in New York where it doesn’t dominate your view.

3- elevators- if your scared of elevators (lifts) it maybe somewhere I avoid.

4- pack your camera

All in all a very enjoyable trip, remember you can make more money but making memories is something to cherish! Thank you Empire State Building it was a pleasure!",4.0,4.9841999999999995

7065,Great view but overall poor experience,"Visited on a Monday evening around 7 pm with my 6 year old daughter. Most employees are (very) unhappy. Crowds are far too large to enjoy the view. There's no seating and you're not allowed to sit on the floor. Can't stand in several places. Children certainly can't enjoy the view. The wait for a possible spot is unbearable. To avoid a long(er) wait time to go up or come down you can climb 7 flights of stairs. Which we did on our way out. The stairs were also hot and crowded. The 7 flights was to get to the floor that had the elevators to go the rest of the way up or down (must transfer elevators).One World Observatory is MUCH more inviting, well organized and provides seating, a place to eat and fun informative displays and presentations. I do not plan on visiting the Empire State Building again.",2.0,4.7424
7066,Expensive but has to be done!!,"Booked ahead and got express tickets. It opens at 8am and we were there early and went straight through so didn't need to be express but on leaving and hour or so later, queues were building.
Lots of info on the way up and down.
Staff everywhere to keep you right and informed.

7075,Visit of ESB NYC family of 4 with young children,"Great experience. A landmark of NYC. The new exhibition with the movies is great. We had the fast track tickets which cost around $ 250 for three paying persons. It helped a lot to make the visit much more relaxed because we could pass almost all waiting lines (getting tickets, going up, going down), so we had time for other things. To be honest lines were not as bad as expected on a morning visit (10 am) during a working day in August, though.",5.0,4.9184

We went through thorough security which was done professionally and quickly. The history is laid out on large viewing boards, photos and models, also a moving image of King Kong looking through a window. The lift to the 79th floor was incredibly quick with moving images on the ceiling showing a1920s scene of construction workers, if you don't like lifts it's a great way to forget your worries as it's well done and entertaining.on getting off at 79th there is more history and pictures then a lift to 86th.all lifts operated by staff dressed in bellhop style uniforms who are well versed in pleasantries.
At the 86th floor you can go outside to the viewing platform which is breathtaking, there is a high fence around it for obvious reasons but it doesn't spoil the view. It was very crowded but most people were polite and waited for a space to appear to get good views and photos.

On your way up you learn about the history of this iconic building through interactive elevator ceiling displays and once on top you are greeted by King Kong himself!
Nothing beats the view once outside on the viewing platform though - a 360 degree panorama of New York City in glorious sunshine, the Manhattan skyline in front of us and Miss Liberty to our right, mid-town and Central Park in our backs, a thousand gleaming roof tops and the city below us in near total silence - truly one of the great views the world has to offer.

We went at about 9am Sunday morning in the summer. I expected the lines to be long and to feel crowded and rushed. I couldn't have been more wrong. There was essentially no line. We had as much time as we wanted entering and taking pictures. The staff was so pleasant. The bathrooms were clean and there were several along the way. We rode up several different elevators on the way up to the deck with historical information as well as different ways to view the beautiful art deco building. The upper deck was busy, but it was still possible to get up to the edge of the building to take many photos all around the building of the New York skyline.

7101,Empire State Building is great!,"It was the first time my daughter and I went to the Empire State building together and it was for any time during the day of our ticket. I read that arriving before 11:00am was best, so we got there close to 10:00am. We got right in line, security, and up in an elevator. The self-paced tour was nice as there were several different areas to watch videos, see interactive films on what it was like back then... how the building was erected, etc. Once you are done with the first set of rooms, you can either take the stairs up 7 flights of stairs, or wait for the elevator to get to the look-out point. It was a bit crowded walking around and trying to see the views, but with patience you got to see the views and take photos from all vantage points. I feel that we took our time and it was about 2-2.5 hours (after going through the gift shop).",5.0,4.7378

But for me, the Empire State Building represents history and culture in a way that the newer buildings simply can't. It is precisely that ""historic"" feel and look that gives it a more inviting presence! To me it will always be emblematic of NYC!!",5.0,4.8166

7107,Wish I could give a higher score,We paid for the express reservation and was a little disappointed that this only affected the initial security line and then for the first set of elevators. Up by the last elevator it was pretty chaotic and there was only one member of staff policing the stairs and the line for the elevator and he didn't cope well with many people pushing/stealing places in the queue. Shame. The chaos meant we missed sunset time.,3.0,1.2078
7108,Absolutely Amazing,"What a treat to witness the sunrise from this amazing building; no line, no wait super friendly staff and max 100 people per visit - totally worth to get up at 5am!",5.0,4.8488
7109,Amazing experience...except,"First, I want to say that the building is pristine and iconic and the exhibits were really interesting. The views from the top after dark were amazing. The employees guiding us throughout the building were very professional and courteous. This should have been an awesome experience...but for one thing.

We had been out and about in NYC for the day where we did a lot of walking and, due to having a 2-year-old and 4-year-old in tow we brought our double stroller. We had tried to park the stroller on the 80th floor in a corner where it looked like it would be out of the way and we could then enjoy the observation deck without having to cart the stroller around. Unfortunately, we were flagged down and told we could not leave the stroller parked anywhere...that it had to be with us at all times to ensure the building's image was maintained. I certainly understood and we brought the stroller up to the observation deck with us. Unfortunately we found that the stroller did not fit well through the observation deck doors and with the large number of people crowding the observation deck was very difficult to maneuver through the crowds to visit different areas and see the full 360 degree view. This became very frustrating rather quickly and it certainly impacted our experience negatively.

What I didn't understand was why there was no stroller valet offered to families like ours? This would have certainly made for a much better experience for our family, would have kept the stroller from littering different areas of the exhibit (thereby maintaining the buildings iconic image) and would have reduced irritation to other guests that had to maneuver around our stroller on the observation deck in the tight spaces where we stopped and enjoyed the view. Considering we paid almost $150 + tax for the experience for our family, I would have expected first-class service like a stroller room or valet. Instead, I felt a bit cheated out of the experience because I was so focused on having to maneuver the stroller through the tight crowds. It turned out to be a bittersweet end to an otherwise amazing day in NYC.",4.0,4.9559999999999995

I was very sad that it has become so commercial. Why can’t these historical monuments be left as is. Way to many changes and it makes the entry free even more expensive.

What I love the most about the empire is the architecture, and its art deco style, cause it is frankly beautiful. Personally, I didnt like all the spectacle and futuristic screens and stuff. From my point of view, this diamond is turned into a vulgar theme park and for me it was quite sad. Maybe kids like it better, but not me.
On the other hand, the staff was really nice. And of course it is the Empire State, which is a master piece.
What I liked the most is the lobby of exit, that does preserve the art deco spirit.",3.0,4.9148

7140,Just got to be done!,Personally I think the Top of the Rock is better as you get a view with the Empire State Building in it! But this is the Empire State Building and shouldn't be missed.

7162,Wow!,If you are visiting NYC for the first time this is obviously one of the main attractions that people want to do. We got the day and night admission ticket which we would 100% recommend - you get to go up once in the morning after 9am and then once in the evening after 8.30pm. The lines up to the observation deck are long and it can take a while however this is for health and safety reasons.

The displays are very well-organized and informative, and the staff are always helpful and friendly. However, I feel it is a bit too expensive to enter the building but, as I said, the views alone make up for it. Additionally, due to the popularity of the building, there is often congestion here, which is a pet hate of mine.

Then there was a short queue to the first elevator (you take two) where the exhibition continues in the lift car. When you transfer to the second elevator for the last few floors you pass through another exhibition area where there are windows giving you a taste of what's to come. Finally out on the viewing deck it really is breathtaking with views in every direction and you can take all the time you want.

Also could've done with a few signposts pointing out what exactly we were viewing from the observatory deck.

I do like the new experience and interactive displays that you get before going up the elevators. However, the crowds always seem to be large and sometimes elbow room can be tough on the 86th floor deck. My main complaint is that the price has become prohibitive. The cost was close to $48/person and this no longer includes access to the 102 floor. Having to pay close to $200 for a family of four is ridiculous. Paying for VIP tickets or special access passes to get to 102 is even worse. The common person or family probably can't afford it.

7198,Redeemed through Explorer Pass no issues!,Loved this place!! This was on my itinerary to go at sunset but the day was very clear and humid so I thought I may as well go up now and take the best pics in an air conditioned building lol. I scanned my pass with no questions asked and went up in the lift. AMAZING views and obviously had to get a video with “Alicia Keys - Empire State” playing in the background to certify my experience HAHA! There were not that many people at the top so could take good pictures without people on my back waiting their turn.,5.0,4.9806

7205,An Icon,"We visited the Empire State Building on a Tuesday night we had prepaid for our tickets which is worth doing as it makes things a little quicker. You start by walking through the history of the worlds most famous building before getting in the main elevator taking you to floor 79, before getting lift 2 or walking up to the 87 floor which is the outdoor observation deck. The views are stunning we decided to go at night to see the city lit up and it did not disappoint 100% a must do activity.",5.0,4.3928
7206,Nearly at top of the world,"Don't get me wrong. I was comparing with the world's tallest tower in Dubai or CN Tower in Toronto. But I must admit the tour to the observatory is well laid out.

7208,Nice views at twilight,Thank god we bought tickets which got us in without lines. We did get in pretty quick all the way up but I felt it was too crowded just like other Manhattan attractions. The best part IMO is you can look and take photos without the glare of glasses even though getting vantage spots can be hard especially with those who are not constrained by time. We were there on a Saturday evening and was too crowded and may be weekdays are better if it fits one's schwdule,4.0,4.9352

However! there is nothing marked once you're inside to let you know how to navigate with a skip the line ticket - so be sure and let every elevator operator you see know that you have that ticket.

Six of us in our party and we arrived early (9.00) to avoid the lines. It worked perfectly, it was not crowded and we did not have to wait. We had great views of the City. They have updated the info and background films and it really helps to get you into the mood and vibe of visiting New York and this iconic attraction. They have some excellent of the background info as to how it was built. I'm always impressed with how quickly they built it. They have information and work schedules about the number of people working on the building at various times. Impressive and well worth a visit.",5.0,4.9696

7216,Sunrise ticket - do it if you can afford the higher ticket price,"we had read reviews about the empire state building and knew it can get extremely busy in the summer months and no chance of getting a nice selfie by the railings without 50 other people in shot. So we decided to go for the sunrise ticket option, which only runs on Fridays and Saturdays and the maximum is 100 people. It did mean we had to be there for 5:15am but out hotel was around the corner so it was not too bad. We waited outside for around 5 minutes before they let us in, it was all very quick and smooth as they wanted to get us up to the top before the sun started coming up. In total there was only 26 people, which was amazing, everyone had their own great view without having to worry about being in someones way or in the background of someones photo. We could spend as much time up the top as we wanted and the sunrise was beautiful. we then went to get some breakfast before coming back when it officially opened to the public to visit the gift shop, which the staff were really helpful with and didn't make us queue up with the many tourists that had already started to pile in. We were also very lucky to have visited just a few days after their new exhibition had opened and got to experience it pretty much on our own, it is very well done and really interesting, I would definitely recommend spending some time in here",5.0,4.9922

7224,Amazing Views,The views from the top of this building are something you will never forget. This is a must visit destination but either arrive early or be prepared to wait for the lifts as this place gets busy. There was either a 4 hour wait to go up in the lifts or climb 10 flights of steep narrow stairs - I took the stairs and it was worth it.,5.0,4.3266

7226,Empire State Building,It's the Empire State Building so you have to check it out. We went at night around 10pm and the views were great.

There was also a cool looking lobby after you exit the store.,4.0,3.843

7235,A must visit to the building for lovely view at least once,We visited this building by buying a skip the line ticket from outside where we were told that long queue is there for ticket but when we reached inside so there was no line.Anyway it was smooth ride to the high floors and view was enchanting. There was a lot of rush there though. Enjoyed a lot but definitely not going there again.,4.0,4.502

7241,Always worth a visit,I've been here for the third time. The observation deck provides a great view on the city. Only two downsides: No drinks or snacks available at the observation deck and there is no option to sit down. So if you'd like to stay for the sunset you'll need a lot of stamina. Also space is limited but I don't count this as a downside hence this ist an old building.,4.0,2.939
7242,No better experience in NYC!!,"I visit the Empire State Building many times throughout the year and there is no better way to experience the magic of NYC than a visit to the Observatory. I always take visitors but, it is such a treat for my wife and I to start or end a NYC evening with a visit to the Empire State Building. The Sunrise Experience is a MUST for EVERY New Yorker and visitor!

If you are headed to the Empire State Building in the evening, Tacombi, on the 33rd Street side of the building is also a MUST. The setting is special and the Mexican street food delicious. It always has a fun crowd and buzz.",5.0,4.9196
7243,Who woukdn't want to visit The Empire State,"I have waited so long to see the Empire State Building, and it didn't let me down.

You can go around the whole building (360 views). IMO, best part of NYC.",5.0,4.8826
7245,"Great view, but very busy","There's a little exhibit when you first walk in that shows how the tower was built. Then there's a cool walk through of the building and how it shows up in movies, especially King Kong. We arrived at about 10:30 am, and it was so busy. It's hard to find a place to take pictures, and the waits for the elevators are crazy. It's worth seeing, but the view from the Top of the Rock is very cool as well, and you get a view of the Empire State Building. Be prepared to spend 2 hours at the Empire State Building to account for wait times.",4.0,4.7258

They offered every once in a while the option to use the stairs for the last 7 floors up and down to ease the elevator line. The crowds up top were friendly enough not lingering too long in prime viewing spots. Just dont but the bottled water in the gift shop wait until you get to the exit downstairs, there is a CVS pharmacy where you can get it cheaper or wait until you get outside and buy from a vendor for 1 dollar.",4.0,4.891

7269,Great View of the Big Apple!,"Either you want to to go the Empire State Building, or you don't. There is no in-between.

Why you wouldn't:
A.) Because you're afraid of heights (which is very valid, mind you).
B.) You don't care.
C.) What is the matter with you? It's the Empire State Building.
D.) You don't like art deco.
E.) Feats of engineering don't impress you.
F. ) You're too busy instagraming you're meal. We get it, you had the chicken parmigiana and it was beautiful. We know it Susan.

Why you would want to visit (there will be no list): A historic building constructed during the great depression, it was iconic of what America was made of: tall, strong, and built with lightning speed for the time period. The structure is reminiscent of a bygone era, with the stone face and steel framework, it is a modern marvel.

The staff were polite and friendly. I would recommend fast passes as getting up to the observation deck can take a long time. We didn't do so, but we were here early enough that it didn't really matter. I will say it was a long walk just to get to the elevator, so I imagine it takes a while when there is a crowd. There's also security, so keep that in mind when visiting. Jimmy will have to leave his pocket knife at home. Also, security bogs down the process of getting through. Another reason to keep security mind, especially with the metal detector.

Oh, so my experience? It was beautiful looking at the New York Skyline. I had a hard time looking over the edge. Because, you know, heights and all that. I didn't want a repeat of Willis Tower (I had a panic attack in their skybox). Otherwise, it was a success of an experience with my wife. Whom is not afraid of heights.",5.0,4.9152000000000005
7270,Empires State Building congested and frustrating,"I went to the ESB on a Friday night in early August with my 8-year old son. It was around 8:00 PM when we got to the ESB and I had purchased tickets online the day before. Initially, everything seemed to run smoothly and efficiently, including the security check point on the first floor. I did have to ask about bathrooms, which were on the second floor, which you could access once you presented your ticket and officially entered the exhibit. Unless you have an express ticket, you have to make your way through a museum/ESB exhibit first. The exhibit was fine, but my son and I really only wanted to get to the observation deck and we were tired, so a nice employee allowed us to take the elevator without having to go through the entire exhibit. My 8-year old was certainlly not interested in learning the history of the ESB at that hour. The first elevator brings you to the 79th floor. The wait for the elevator to the 86th floor was 30 min. However, if you are able, you can walk up 7 flights of stairs to get to the observation deck, which is what we did. Once we got to the 86th floor, we entered a full room of people, and beyond the room, the actual outside observation deck. However, people were crammed together like sardines. After elbowing our way outside, I realized there was simply no way to navigate around the deck of the building to take in the sweeping views without a lot of time and patience. We called it a night after really not seeing anything except for a quick peek toward the Freedom Tower and Statue of Liberty. I simply didn't have the energy to paw my way through throngs of people and wait to get a decent viewing spot. It was just too much for me. Back inside the room, it had become a bit chaotic. It looked like lines were forming to take the elevators back down, but some people were just milling around trying to figure out how to get outside. Others wanted to take the stairs back down, but it took a few mintues before we were allowed this option. Finally back on the 79th floor, it wasn't obvoius where you needed to go to head back to the ground level. We finally found our way, but alas, you had to meander your way through the souvenier shop, which was quite large. There was simply no easy way to escape. So, all in all, I didn't have a great experience. If you like fewer people, go when ESB first opens or go late at night.",3.0,4.7486

There were six tour busses there at the time we visited (10:30 pm). Wanted to see the city all light up and it was just like you see in the movies. So why 2 stars. We actually wanted to see the Empire State Building and the iconic elevator ride. They are redoing all of this so we got a partial ride in one elevator then a slow, hot and miserable wait in a service hallway to wait for the second elevator. It was 94 degrees and 85% humidity. Not a great combination in a service hallway. I guess I now know what the sewer and data lines look like. Really not worth the $$ and after One world trade really not worth the $$",2.0,2.1638

7283,Tourist cliche and worth every moment.,"It is annoying my earlier reviews or persona have gone. The date is therefore inaccurate.

What is to say? The views are superb, the wait even in August, was not excessive, and the interiors are breathtakingly well executed. Lift doors walls and ceilings in the communal area are world class.

The shop and tourist related perks were very reasonably priced and well located.",5.0,4.3616
7284,First class service in the Official Store,"I visited New York with my husband in May for our honeymoon and of course had to visit The Empire State Building. I bought a beautiful charm of the Empire State for my charm bracelet and must have just been extremely unlucky to have bought a faulty one; a week after returning home to the UK, I noticed the building had broken off of the charm loop never to be seen again. You can imagine my disappointment! I emailed the store with zero expectation of replacement but felt it necessary to point out the fault. Much to my amazement and delight, (and after seeing proof of the broken charm and proof of purchase), I have today received a replacement charm.
The service they offered was absolutely impeccable and a cut above the rest! Thank you so much to Melissa and Roberto who made this happen!!",5.0,4.8656

Once I got over the fear of knowing how high we were traveling in the Elevator and stepped out onto the plat form it took a moment to relax but the view was surreal, almost like it was fake looking out onto that huge city high above some truly tall buildings. Seeing out and truly come to understand what most of our immigrant relatives helped build. (I am Italian and my family came through Ellis Island) . Most of my family still lives in NY and a lot of them helped with 911 for months. It put so much into perspective for me, to understand the undertaking that went on in Manhattan 911 and beyond, and knowing my family helped create that beautiful GRID of a city. For me was a truly emotional experience.",4.0,4.9412

Fantastic views of New York and the surrounds made it worthy. Take your time and do a 360 degree walk around the total building taking plenty of photos and use the landmark guides to get your best photo opportunity.

Staff was very attentive and helpful.",5.0,4.896
7316,Spectacular evening views,"We visited on a Wednesday evening around 8:30pm. We only waited about 10 minutes for an elevator to go to the top.

7322,Incredible new exhibits and iconic bucket list building,"During a recent visit to NYC, my wife and I purchased tickets to check out the Empire State Building as it was only a short walk from our hotel.

Not knowing what the wait times would be during our visit, we purchased VIP Express Pass tickets which saved us a little time waiting in lines.

**Hint: There are not always dedicated/marked express VIP pass lines. If you purchase the express pass and you find yourself waiting in a line, speak up and mention to the building hosts in burgundy that you have an express pass. They will often pull you out of the line and escort you to the very front of the line.**

Had we visited on a weekend during peak times, I'm sure the passes would have saved us considerably more time.

On July 29th the Empire State Building opened a brand new exhibit on the history of the building. The exhibit is modern, interesting and definitely provides justification for the high entrance fee for the tickets.

Of course, the whole reason to visit is for the views from the observatory and the views do not disappoint. Although you can expect the observatory to be far more crowded than it appears in celebrity photos or in movies. However, with a little patience you should be able to work your way as close to the edge as you dare to get some amazing photographs of NYC and the surrounding areas.",5.0,4.9572

7330,Awesome and worth the crowd,"Each of our family of 6 enjoyed this, ages 5-45. It was crowded, like body smells and touching crowded, if you are claustrophobic this may not be the place for you. I think a lady full body pressed me against the wall on the upper deck for 5 seconds, not her fault, we were just literally packed like sardines. Still, the view is unbelievable and iconic.

7342,Update is Impressive and worth taking the time to enjoy!,"We happened to arrive at the grand opening of the newly improved Empire State Building Attraction.

It was my 7yr old’s favorite experience while in NYC for several days. Definitely a must see and not too boring for younger kids!",5.0,4.9642
7343,Empire State Building - Express Not Worth The Cost,"My wife and I took our 10 year old grandson to the Empire State Building Sunday, July 28th at dusk. I purchased express tickets at ~$80 each to bypass lines and for audio. Upon arrival there was no one to assist us in how to use the Express Line, let alone how to scan our vouchers. I finally found someone to help, which took around 5 minutes. Not very express. We were never offered audio equipment, which was supposed to come with the express tickets. It was very over crowded during our time there. People would camp out along the railings thereby keeping others from getting good views and pictures. No one was trying to move people along. Very frustrating for us as we were essentially shut out from the rail. I was suffering from lower back issues meaning I needed a short rest to sit down. There was no place to sit and the attendant was very rude regarding my need to sit. I went into the east side lobby and there were dozens of people sitting on the floor. I joined them as I really needed to get off my feet. Within a couple of minutes this same attendant forced everyone to get up. I went over to the west side lobby and again, there were a lot of people sitting on the floor. I joined them and spent a good 10 minutes resting my back. If there is a rule to not sit anywhere they need to enforce it everywhere. We will never go back to this site and I recommend you to strongly consider going to the Freedom Tower instead as the space is much bigger, is in AC and they are extremely nice.",1.0,2.5987999999999998

7352,Nice view but crowded place,"The view was very nice. There wasn't a long line so you could get up on the 86th floor in 5 minutes. I went to watch the sunset and NYC by night : beautiful ! However here are a few tips I would recommend : get a pass if you can to avoid the line and paying full price. Also if you travel on your own : put headphones on and some great music to enjoy the view. The tourists you meet up there are for the most part very loud and not very well educated (some of them will occupy the same spot for over an hour despite lots of people waiting to take a picture).

If you don't want to spend the money on this or if you can't afford it, there are also different free spots from which you can get a nice view.

One thing I absolutely HATED : they take a picture of you then print it then offer you to buy it for 26$. If you don't buy it : they toss it !!!! That's right, you read correctly, what a waste !!!!! That is ink and paper in the trash even though it would make someone happy. Who does that in 2019 ?! Oh Americans.....",3.0,4.8966

We had to fight for a spot to see and take pictures. We stayed a few minutes and left. I don't recommend this. The One World Observatory is much much better.",2.0,4.4074

7359,Extremely crowded in the evening.,"A very good view of the cities skyline. For such an old building, this place is very well managed. It was however very crowded during the sunset time, which we unknowingly were there for, have no idea what the reason is to watch the sun setting behind high towering buiding... the plus is that they have an outside viewing gallery, so you do not have to watch the sights behind glass windows.",4.0,4.0489999999999995
7360,Night time view,"To start off, imo tickets are overpriced for access to the 86th floor. Military discount is only $2 off per ticket for those active duty members visiting. You take 2 elevators up. The first one takes you to the 79th floor. They offer stairway access to reach the 86th floor and skip the line. We took the stairs down from the 86th floor to the 79th and then the elevator the rest of the way down. The view is impressive though! I would have liked to compare the daytime view to the nighttime one.",3.0,4.6956
7361,An enjoyable experience,"The building speaks for itself and the views from the observatory are spectacular.

7364,Sunrise on the Empire State Building,"We had an early start having to be there for 05:15 which wasn't a problem with the jetlag!

We arrived a little earlier but when the doors were open visitors were checked of a list and given souvenir tickets and photo opportunity by the model in the lobby. From then straight through security and into the lifts and we were at the top within 15 minutes of entering the building, so you get to see Manhattan still in the dark and at sunrise as well as full daylight!

The ""experience"" is limited to 100 people but there were no more than 30 on the day we visited so you had no problems wandering around the observation deck and seeing all the sights and taking all the photos you want. Luckily for us the sunrise was splendid with clear skies. We were not rushed or pushed around and could stay as long as we wanted.

As their were so few people it felt like a private tour so well worth it for not having to fight to get the photo opportunity you want (Especially considering one of the staff said there would be upwards of 1,500 people on the observation deck later in the day!).

Yes it was more expensive than the standard tour but well worth it for the view and ""private"" feel of the observation deck - just try not to book on a cloudy day!!",5.0,4.984

7378,Amazing view,"We took the elevator up to the eighty-sixth floor. Interesting video in the elevator, during the ascendance, about of the construction of the Empire. From the 86th the view is spectacular. I would have liked to go up to the 106th floor but it was closed. The only negative note is the cost: $ 40 each... in my opinion it too expensive. I didn't spent so much for the museums, maximum $ 25 per entry.",4.0,1.9788
7379,The highlight of the trip.,We visited here in June. We had already spoken to a night security guard who works at the Empire State in Times Square prior and he said the best time to go when it’s not really crowded was at 10am which is when we went. This seemed to be a good time and we got to see everywhere without having to queue. The view is incredible definitely worth going up to see. Will be going again when I go back to New York.,5.0,4.8402
7380,Great views but......,"Well, I can say I have done it. Many cities have many buildings and towers you can go up and have a look.
It is well organised, and does have great views, however for the price about $40-50 AUD. Gets expensive to look at a view and take a few photos. I could have done that online for free.
If you do go check out all the discounts online, tickets vary in price by about 50% for a exactly the same thing.

Would I do it again? No.
Am I glad I did it? I guess so.
There are so many more things to do and see the trip would not have been any less without doing it, and a couple of hundred dollars more in the family’s pocket for other things.
You can just make out the Statue of Liberty in the distance. Now that is so iconic I am glad we did go and see it.",3.0,4.9186

7384,Not bad,"It was good. Views were great in all directions with plenty of free binoculars up there. We went early, around 8.30 and no lines were a bonus. You can buy there at machines or buy in advance and print off to scan there. I was a bit disappointed you didn't see much of the 1930s marble interiors. It was all a bit modern and plastic.

All in all good view but a tad too much money .Sleepless in Seattle was on the 86th floor . 103rd not necessary. The highlight of my trip was the fabulous woman working there who let people know they could go up higher but wanted to make sure they knew that meant they were walking up 7 floors of stairs. She was worth every cent.",3.0,4.7108

7402,Beautiful at night,"My husband and I bought tickets last minute after eating in the restaurant on the ground floor. We did not buy the express pass and I am glad we didn’t. It was a Friday night around 8-8:30 when we started and it didn’t take long to reach the top. We had beautiful views of the city lit up. It was a bit annoying going down because they take everyone in stages. Also it was HOT waiting in line. I would recommend going at night, skipping the express pass (unless you have kids- if we had brought our kids, skipping the line would’ve been totally worth it), and taking loads of pics.",5.0,4.7374
7403,Amazing but with some problem,"Good organisation but i haven't had the multimedial support garanteed form advertising. I have found the site with audioguide and, generally, woth exception of skip the line no other facilitation are insider the price that i have payed (80 dollar)",3.0,3.8038

One suggestion, when we were trying to leave to go back down, the employee made an announcement but we could not hear what he said. We continued to stand in line to go down on the elevator, when we got to the front, he said we were in the line to go down the stairs. I was on crutches. Luckily, he allowed me to go ahead and go down the elevator but that 1st employee needs to have a megaphone or SOMETHING so everyone knows what line to get into. Thank you!!",5.0,4.8922

7411,Skip the Empire State. Go to Freedom Tower instead.,"My family and I thought we should check the Empire State Building off of our bucket lists on our second trip to NY. It was so crowded that we couldn't even really see the views. Or move. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone with anxiety or cholostrophobia. In our opinions, it was a waste of time and money. If you want beautiful views of the city and a nice relaxing atmosphere, I'd recommend Freedom Tower 100%!",2.0,4.678
7412,Expensive but iconic,"We really enjoyed the views and the museum portions. $42 per person is a steep price for this attraction, but it is still a must see.",4.0,4.0988
7413,Beautiful View!,You learn a lot of information about NYC and you have a fantastic view for miles. It's worth visiting.,5.0,4.341
7414,Must see.,Must do when you visit New York. Best time to go is at sunset so you get to see the lights coming on.,5.0,4.2738
7415,Great Timing,We went at 6pm mid week and there was no queue what so ever. The views are spectacular and well worth a visit.,4.0,3.4046
7416,Still amazing,"Still amazing view and kinda cool to have a photo with one of the binoculars as many famous people. It provides great view of the city.

Highly recommendable.",5.0,4.7444
7417,Busy but still got great views and pics,"We went during a very busy time (they were offering people to walk the stairs instead of taking the elevators busy.) When we got to the top, it was busy for sure. BUT not so busy that you couldn't get great views and even great people free pics in front of the NY skyline of your choice. The views wrap the whole way around the building so you can definitely get the views you want.
The staff were very friendly even though it was clearly rush hour and crazy hot.
Hint: don't wear green as you'll only show up as a torso-less head in the picture that they take ;-)",5.0,4.7318
7418,"Sunrise experience, worth the price!","I did the sunrise experience (which is capped at a maybe 100 people per day) for around $90 and it was definitely worth every cent. The fact that you can access the ESB and miss the crowds, view the sunrise and take decent photos without people walking in front of your camera, made the cost worthwhile. Having braved some other tourist spots in peak season with literally thousands of tourists, I felt like I needed a treat. The view was spectacular and watching the city wake up, was really special.

The staff were also really friendly. I lost the piece of paper I wrote their names down on but I there were two male staff members from ESB who helped me find a decent diner to eat at, due to the restaurant on site being closed. The were heading to Captain's Cafe, where we ended up eating breakfast together. I spent a pleasant morning chatting and eating with them.

I would really like to thank the two staff members who helped me as they went above their duty to make sure I wasn't wandering the city alone at silly o'clock in the morning finding some place decent to eat.",5.0,4.9336
7419,Time It Right,We found out the hard way that those who get to the observation deck before sunset understandably do not want to leave until sometime after sunset. This makes those that are in line behind them wait an extra 45 minutes to an hour over a normal wait. Consider this when timing your visit.,5.0,2.757
7420,"Definitely the ""View""","Well worth going to see. My wife and I had never gone before and we enjoyed seeing what we had missed all the years. It was a part of our hop-on bus tour otherwise we might not have done it, but we are glad we did.",4.0,4.523
7421,Proposal,"I have visited Empire State several times in the past.
At this time, I have to say that the waiting time has been decreased significantly and in just 30' we have climbed back on the 86th floor.
This was a unique experience for me, as I realized one of my dreams, which was to make a proposal at the top floor.
This came true and a big thanks to Empire State Buiilding and its personnel for making it happen.",5.0,4.6962
7422,Amazing experience!!,"Usually when I travel to New York for a weekend I love to do the same thing every time which is arriving early on a Friday and going to a Yankee game on a Friday night, touring the city (Battery Park, 9/11 memorial, trump tower, Central Park, Rockefeller Center, Times Square at night) all on Saturday and leaving on a Sunday morning to go home. This year when I went I did those same things and had to do something different, so I went to the top of the rock.

It was my first time going to the top and I was excited but nervous because I have a fear of heights. It’s worth every penny once you get to the top. As you ride the elevator to the top there’s a cool video that plays on the ceiling until you reach the top floor. Staff there was helpful in guiding everyone to the right place and keeping lines and crowds organized. They had a couple of gift shops up top too to buy souvenirs.

The view was breathtaking. You could see all of New York City, from the Statue of Liberty to Yankee Stadium in the Bronx. There were many observation decks, one facing the north and the other facing the south. You could even go up an escalator that took you one deck higher above everyone else. This place is also where the impractical jokers filmed an episode of their comedy tv show back in season 5 (which I believe was in 2016). Highly highly recommend.",5.0,4.9772
7423,Empire State Bldg Observation Deck,"We walked straight up to the gate and scanned in our tickets. No issues.

It was a beautiful day and although a bit crowded, the ushers were very polite and welcoming.

The gift shop prices were extremely high. A baseball cap for $40. A block down the street a very similar hat was $19.

Bucket list to do when in NYC.",4.0,4.5518
7424,Amazing sunset!,I highly recommend booking this ticket as this is a direct-entry one! Going at sunset was even more amazing (although the crowds were pretty huge) as one could see the orange skies across the Hudson & East Rivers.,5.0,4.7707999999999995
7425,Get up early and enjoy,"Arrived yesterday from UK with 2 children, 6 and 11 years old. Both woke up at 3am with messed up body clocks..got them back to sleep for a few hours, breakfast at 7.15, one block walk from hotel to ESB, then through observatory door at 8am, barely any people on way up, no queue for tickets, staff really warm and friendly, and could have as many photo opportunities at top as we wanted. Amazing early morning experience, highly recommended and fully enjoyed by all of the family. We even witnessed a young Dutch guy propose to his girlfriend in their 10th anniversary, took a photo for them-congrats guys!",5.0,4.8138000000000005

7427,Great views!,Great place to view the skyline of New York. We used an Explorer Pass to see this building. It takes a little time to get up to the top and if you are able walk the last 6 stories up as it is quicker that waiting for one of the 2 elevators that are available from this point upward. (it's a workout!) Huge gift shop for anyone who needs a souvenier. Well worth it.,4.0,4.849
7428,Incredible experience,You can't say you visited NYC without visiting Empire State. Get the city pass to do it. I recommend to bring a pair of binoculars so you can better enjoy the view.,5.0,4.6688
7429,A classic NYC attraction that never grows old,Our group had a wonderful time at the ESB. The history of the building is presented in an interesting and informative way. The staff was helpful and courteous. Lines kept moving and the crowd flow was handled well. Then the views! Indescribable. Our disabled companion was able to enjoy the visit as did we all.,5.0,4.9046
7430,Better view at Rockefeller,"We had a City Pass and did both the Empire State Building and Top of the Rock observation deck. I would saw the Top of the Rock had better views. Using the City Pass, we had no hassle getting into the rather short line to get to the top. We did climb from the 79th to the 86th by stairs as the elevator wait was long. If you only have time for one, do the other.",4.0,4.2498000000000005
7431,Awesome!,"What a great place. I cant say enough about what a nice experience we had today at the Empire State Building. I had reservations about going there and possibly being a tourist trap but I was wrong. The building is so well kept it is amazing. The staff was incredibly helpful and friendly. If you go, do it right away in the morning, the line was very small.",5.0,4.9076
7432,Ridiculous queue times,"Overall we did enjoy our visit to the Empire State building as the views are obviously stunning however the actual experience was really not great. We queued and queued and queued and just when we thought we had finally made it, absolute shock there was another queue. It really was quite ridiculous, especially the fact you are given no indication as to waiting times. I have seen lots of people say that would be helpful and I would agree. I have seen them reply to people and say 'come during our non peak hours!' but these are either the crack of dawn or incredibly late at night which isn't really realistic when on a city break there.
When we finally got up there it was absolutely jam packed. People were being shoved right, left and centre and we actually saw an argument in which a woman had pushed a baby to get a better view - I mean come on, something needs to be done. Obviously the views were very pretty and it was great to see but I don't think I would recommend this if you are looking for an 'enjoyable' experience. I think they should take a leaf out of the Rockefeller, which we also did, and give people allotted times. This would massively cut down on queues and fights up at the top.",3.0,1.4646
7433,Views are magnificent!,This was a surprise! We did it Bc we were being touristy. But it turned out to be a wonderful experience! Would have liked to have done it at night too—-just to have two different views!,5.0,4.8073999999999995
7434,Amazing experience at the Empire State Building,"Must-do attraction in New York to have a wonderful views of the city.
Just went to the Observatory 86th floor. Don't know whether climbing to the top is worth it or not.
We arrived around 6:30 pm, no queue, perfect. We stayed there till 9pm to see the sunset. Around 7:30 or 8pm, the place is very crowded though. Lot of waiting.
Plan ahead by buying your tickets on internet. No need to print them.",5.0,4.7316
7435,Standard NYC tourist attraction,"Visiting the Empire State Building is like visiting any other skyscraper. The views of the city are fantastic.
A couple things to consider.
1. Get the ticket to go up during the day and again at night. Seems odd to go to the same place twice in one day but it is neat to the city all lit up at night.
2. Get a city pass or other multi attraction pass. Individual tickets are too expensive but if you are going to go to other tourist attractions invest in the pass. You will save overall.
3. Go at off peak times (can be found on back of city pass ticket). Again, a tall building. Cool to see but wouldn’t be worth staying in line for hours. We went at off peak time and were up and down in an hour.",4.0,4.9482
7436,Too many people at once,"While it was still beautiful, there are way too many people outside on the top at once. It would make it so much more enjoyable if a group of 100 people were allowed outside at a time for 15-20 mins. Then rotate through.",3.0,4.6928
7437,Iconic,"Well what a great iconic landmark! We went about 9.30am and had NYCPasses and the queues were hardly worth mentioning at this time, all smoothly upto the top in about 10 mins. Views are as to be expected. The only down side is the photograph you have taken before you go up and you get a ticket for which you check when you come down and they want to charge you $25 for an 8 x 6 print. We didn't buy and neither did I see anyone else purchase when we were there, this despite them printing the photo already for you to take away. If the photo was a more reasonable price say $10, we would have bought one, perhaps if they lowered the price they may sell more? Especially as it was already printed and would only be thrown away afterwards. By the way same thing happens at the Top of the Rock except they want $29 for one of $39 for two and they show you the photos with diffbackgrounds on an iPad before you buy, so at least they don't waste money printing them first, still expensive though. We visited Empire State and Top of the Rock and preferred the view from there. You can't see the Empire State from the Empire State Building, go to the Rock for the best iconic view of this building is my opinion.",4.0,4.9094

7443,Can't Beat It,"The Empire State Building is still one of the quintessential ""must-see"" attractions in NYC. The staff runs a tight ship and there's always someone on hand to answer any questions. Truly one of the best ways to ""see"" all of NYC if you can't physically get to every place on the island in one day.",5.0,4.8402
7444,FAST PASS IS A MUST! Great experience but wayyy to many people,"I loved the experience of using the fast pass (it's a must as lines are always 3 hours or more any time of day)! We slipped right past all of the lines and were able to complete the whole experience in less than 35 minutes. Stayed on the roof for about 20-30 mins, however, we would have stayed longer if there weren't so many people. I felt like a canned sardine at times and had difficulties even seeing being short unless I pushed/waited to get to the front. Some kind of system needs to be in place to limit the amount of people upstairs at one time.",4.0,4.3392
7445,Nice view but too expensive,"We are family with children ages 16,14 and 10

7447,Classic New York,"This is something you have to do even if it might to be thought of as too touristy or cheesy. We visited at about 10 am and didn't have to queue so I would recommend visiting early in the day. The views from the first level you stop at is through windows and you are best waiting until you stop at the observation deck. This deck is just as you remember from ""Sleepless in Seattle"" and if you are there in front of the crowds you can get good photo opportunities looking across Manhattan including down to Liberty Island and across to Central Park area as well as all around. When you exit downstairs go down the escalators and you will be in the main lobby and this is also a good place to take pictures of a model of the building and a large commerative plaque.",5.0,4.8968

Take in the history of construction, materials used, labor used, and the speed of construction along the way as you reach the top. The elevators have a ""screen"" on the ceiling that make the ride up and down more enjoyable in a crowded elevator. The views were great and we took in the views from all 4 sides pointing out landmarks and getting perspective of other buildings in NYC. I liked the open air view of NYC and on a hot day, was much more comfortable than the city streets.",5.0,4.9559999999999995

7454,Perfect for night skyline view,"The empire state is a must if you want to get an excellent view of the city skyline but we would personally recommend going up the building at night time. Not only is it quieter and less congested, it also offers a beautiful view of the city lit up at night. Personally prefer the Top of the Rock during the day as you get a better view of central park which is a must see.

The top of the building offers station binoculars which are free and can use them to see the statue of liberty lit up, and provides a great view of the One world trade centre.",4.0,4.9765999999999995

7456,Nighttime City Views,We did the Skip Line and Night time Observatory. Since we went Thursday evening I don't think we needed the skip line. I definitely recommend the night trip to the top. To see the city all lit up at night was amazing. It looks just like the black and white pictures you see of NYC at night. The dimensions of the buildings and the architecture are worth the trip!,5.0,4.8518
7457,nice memory,"I had visited the place forty years ago, the building was as originally, with the super fast lifts and the museum of the guiness book was in the building. The renovation has made him lose some magic, the modern stainless steel allows to see better than the old rusty barriers, but it has less charm. Well organized tour, very clean place.",4.0,4.795

7459,Empire State Building. What else?,Empire State Building is the most famous skycraper in the world and his fame is widely deserved. Beautiful view and personal very kind. The only sad note is that when look at the Freedom Tower I can't help but imaging the Twin Towers like in 1990.,5.0,4.6734
7460,Visit early: no lines!,"We took one of our sons and his daughter to see this building on a very hot Sunday in NYC. It was almost 100 degrees F at street level, but rather pleasant with the nice breeze at the 86th floor. The sight was amazing, and we could see no need to go to the 102nd floor. There were lots of people, but no over-crowded conditions; photos were possible from every side. Yes, it is a bit pricey (even if 2 of us only had to pay for 'seniors' tickets. Take time to see the photos lining the walls of the lobby. Go early.",5.0,4.8322

7471,Too many people,Such beautiful views in my honest opinion they need to regulate how many people go up at a time no one wants to leave the view or let you go in to take a picture because it is so over crowded! Maybe like a 15 minute -30 roatation!,3.0,4.6706

7473,Best tour in NYC,I was inspired by the Art Deco architecture. The building is a work of art. The views were also fabulous. I also loved all the information about how the building was built.,5.0,4.777
7474,A nice stop...,"Even if you choose to not do a tour inside, you can and should walk on by and get a few pictures. We didn't have enough time on this trip, but still walked by and let the kiddos (8 and 5) see it for the first time. If you do the tour, get reservations and SKIP THE LINE tickets. In the past, that is definitely the way to go...especially if you want to go around sunset.",4.0,4.744

Loved it",5.0,4.6184
7478,Too crowded,"In my opinion there were too many people and it was almost impossible to take a picture. They should organise it differently, maybe assign hours like Top of the Rock. We even had to use te stairs for the last 7 floors to get to the top. Other than that it offers a beautiful view of the city.",3.0,4.6804
7479,Excellent view and service,It was clean and in perfect conditions. The staff was very kindly. The service excellent and the organization was very good. The view at day and night was georgeous and amazing. Looking the sunset from the top was one of the most beautiful things I had ever seen. I recommend this attraction 100%.,5.0,4.9712
7480,Great views of the city!,"It’s great to get an eagle eye view of the streets of Manhattan.
Check your weather, far better in sunnier weather.
Has free telescopes which are a plus however the metal rails do obscure the view a lot more than first thought.

If you are looking to compare ESB to TOTR, Rockefeller Center is far better in my opinion. TOTR is closer to Central Park so has great views of uptown and downtown. From ESB Central Park is mostly hidden behind other buildings.
TOTR also has glass walls to provide unobscured views of manhattan - this could be provided at the very top of ESB however it was currently closed for refurbishment (and cost more in ticket price to go up to the top level) so be sure to check before you visit.
TOTR also allows you to capture ESB in pictures as it is a more picturesque building to look at, which also adds to the view.",4.0,4.9643999999999995
7481,Great Views/Why So Expensive?,"We hadn’t been to the top in years, so we splurged. I’m not sure why they charge so much — they should make this more affordable for families!

If you go, consider the timing — we went during the late afternoon (4:30-ish), and had little wait time. If you go during peak hours, prepare to wait in line.",5.0,2.7672
7482,PAY EXTRA FOR EXPRESS!,"The view is unmatched, it's the reason for the visit. BUT it is crowded and the line without express is long and spans many floors. I couldn't imagine waiting so long, with a family, only to get to the top and having to find a spot in the crowd to see the city. The only reason the trip was worth the view was because we got the express tickets. No wait and you literally pass by everyone, you even get in front of them on the elevator. Our trip up to the top took about 10-15 minutes mostly because you pass through security and you have to go through 3 elevators to get to the top. So please do yourself a favor, if you're financially able, PAY FOR EXPRESS!",4.0,4.8248
7483,Simply a must see!,Iconic landmark that wraps New York history and beauty together. Simply amazing and a must in any visitors trip to New York.,5.0,4.672
7484,Iconic,"During our visit we went to The Top of The Rock and One World Observatory.

While they all have there plus points I think the view from the Empire State is the best compromise. You can see both Downtown to the financial district and uptown to Central Park.

There is a reasonable amount of room up top to move around and you can get picture without glass in the way.",5.0,4.5565999999999995
7485,LOVELY OLD PIECE OF ARCHITECTURE,Since childhood wanted to see this (remember King Kong). Best thing is to go Rockerfellas at night and then see the sun set when they light up Empire State Building. It stands majestic in NYC and the architecture in wonderful,5.0,4.672

7487,Best View of New York City,I visited Empire State Building on a weekend. I planned on visiting at the night time as I thought it was going to be very busy in the day time. My night time experience was the best visit I had of the Empire State Building. You do not need to have the express pass if you are visiting the Building at night time as there is no line. I do advise that visitors go after 10pm or even after 11pm to get a more relaxed visit of the Empire State Building.,5.0,4.5148
7488,Tourist trap,Coming to NY we figured we had to do the observatory at the Empire State Building but were very disappointed. You're just moved from one line to the next finally making it to the top where the views aren't nearly as good as Top of the Rock.,2.0,1.7032
7489,The Empire State building is a must see!,Lots of great pictures were taken. The views of the city were amazing. The staff was great as they guided you to a new section of the building.,5.0,4.8372
7490,Great experience all round,"My wife and I had a brilliant experience, and especially want to give a shout out to Craig S. who was amazing and took great care of us! He took us up in the lift, made sure we were ok (I walk with a stick due to a bad back), and was so friendly and helpful!

After reading some reviews I’d been a little worried it might have been overcrowded up there but when we went (about 16:45) the observation deck was probably only a third full. We usually only waited a few seconds to get to the railings for the views.

My back then started to give out, but after bumping into Craig again he made sure we got down quickly, after my wife persuaded him to pose for a selfie with us! The man is a legend!

Overall, really enjoyed it and views are totally worth it!",5.0,4.9482
7491,Totally crowded and couldn’t see anything,"The observatory was totally crowded and couldn’t enjoy the view, paid too much for nothing. People would stay at the fence forever and you couldn’t see anything or take pics",1.0,3.9878
7492,Empire State,"This is the third time we’ve visited, the last time was 20 years ago. It’s still fantastic, better in my opinion than One World Trade as you are outside and get the full effect of looking down with the wind blowing around you, gives me the shivers. Our teenage boys enjoyed it, we spent over an hour up there and no complaints about not being able to use their phones.
Top tip, when we booked, the email said the tickets were valid for a specific date, the tickets when they printed had no date on them. We went on the date specified on the booking email, the weather was poor, staff told us we could go up but that we’d see nothing, they suggested we come another time. I told them I was under the impression that my ticket was for that specific day. They told me that the ticket was actually valid for a year from date of purchase, we tried again the following day and the tickets scanned at the entry without any problem 😁",5.0,4.4258
7493,"Long lines, disorganized, only concerned about profit","Just not what I wanted to be. We went at 1130pm to miss the lines, and it was overall a disappointment. The line was astronomical, the elevators were hardly working so we had to walk the stairs. Even then, the wait was long and tedious. Once in the observation deck, there were so many people, we couldn’t see anything. I was surprised to learn that the photo they take early in the line, on the green screen, is a cost to purchase. Even though they print it, and have it waiting for you to see once you get down. Even after buying tickets to get up to the deck. Just way too expensive. Better views of the city elsewhere, for much less.",1.0,2.9484

7497,"Great view, not great organization","The view from the Empire State Building is obviously fantastic. You can't beat seeing Manhattan from the sky. The problem was in the process of getting to the stop. First was finding the correct door to enter. The poor doorman must repeat the same thing hundreds of times each day since you have to go to a specific door to go to the top. After that, getting to the 79th floor is easy and very clear. Getting from the 79th to 86th floor was not too bad....just follow the lines and your turn to the elevators. But you want to leave? Better ask somebody because there is no clear direction where to go. We walked in circles a few times before we found someone to ask and were pointed in the right direction. There is no ""exit"" line...just go back to the elevators and ask the person there to send you down. Kind of strange and wish there had been some signs directing.",3.0,4.5416

Staff rely nice and helpful and the two lifts to the top enjoyable as theres a short movie on the ceiling on the first lift , once you're at the top and step outside onto the viewing gallery if is awesome especially after you read the many information boards about the towers build. The views are fantastic so it's a definite must do and no hesitation in recommending the Empire State.",5.0,4.9361999999999995
7500,On top of the world,"How anybody could ever rate this below 5* is beyond me. The queue time was barely anything especially when you get to the top!

The lift stops at approx the 79th floor (which takes 51 seconds from ground), then up to the 86th... you can then go up to the 102nd floor too, but this does cost an extra $20 ish per person.

The views are breathtaking, you can see everything and feel on top of the world. There are no pictures that could ever do these views justice as it is a ""see it to believe it"" sort of view.

Definitely worth getting the visitors pass and then you get even more value for your money!",5.0,4.9128

7502,Favourite New York experience!,"I loved going up the Empire State Building, the views at the top were absolutely amazing!

7505,Express Pass worth every penny but make sure you ask questions along the way!,"My daughter and I decided at the last minute on a Saturday night to visit the Empire State building. We sprang for the Express tickets as the line seemed very long. It was amazing how fast we were whisked up to the top but you need to know a few things. First, you start out in the express queue but everyone has to go through security so there is a bit of a wait there. It is very important to keep your pass in your hand and tell the guards along the way that you are an Express ticket holder! Gates opened up and elevators waited for us but because the crowds can be large, you might not realize right away which way you should be going. At the 79th floor in particular, we started to wait in the line with everyone else to get to the 86th floor observatory but when I asked a guard, she immediately put us on an elevator. The same thing happened going down. After you have spent time on the Observatory deck, you are ushered into a crowd waiting to go down the elevators. We found a guard and once again, we were put immediately put on an elevator. I think it just gets confusing up there with all of the people. Anyway, we had an amazing time and thought it was worth every penny!!",5.0,4.9268

7508,Boring,"I just got home from a 2 week vacation where I attended dozens of activities and my visit to the Empire State Building was one of my least favorite activities. There wasn't any problem with the building itself. Staff was friendly, lines were short (I had express tickets, which I utilized, but the lines were short regardless), the premises was clean. The problem was that the experience was boring. I went up to balcony level and did what, looked over the railing. After 5 minutes I've seen everything. That's it? That costed me $82? That's worth no more than $10 in my opinion. I do not plan to recommend this activity to anybody else or be back myself.

Also, I was encouraged to send my concerns to reviews@esbonyc.com. I did that but didn't get a response.",2.0,4.4318
7509,Empire State Building,Excellent tour. Helpful staff and easy to access. We got there early in the morning and there was not a huge queue so we got to the 86 floor rather quickly.

My only complaint would be some signage on the top floor. Would be great to look and see what all the buildings and landmarks are.",3.0,4.82
7539,Very good experience,"Very good experience, a bit overprised. I would recommend it though as you can see the whole of Manhattan from up there. The entry procedure was very smooth with no delays.",4.0,3.9978
7540,"Great view, price too high","Great view of NYC, a must see. Staff was really nice. However, 170$ US total for a family of 4 (2 adults and 2 kids) is just too expensive for what it’s worth. More explanations about the historique of the building should be included with the regular visit.",3.0,4.6878
7541,Worth a visit,"Great views of the City on a clear day and a NYC icon. a must really for anyone visiting NYC, very well organised and did not even have to queue.",5.0,4.6878
7542,Professional staff,"99% of the time, the staff who usher tourists around all day tend to be quite terse, often even brusk and rude. Not so at the Empire State Building. Every staff member with whom we interacted was warm, friendly and professional. I even told them so, which seemed to make them happy. Very impressive. Thanks for the visit. For visitors, be sure to consider the new entrance 34th st. It's very nice and doesn't lack any of the art deco flavor.",5.0,4.9158
7543,Fabulous,We decided to go up to the top just before sunset and do both day and night photographs in one go with bonus gorgeous sunset pictures too. We have one teen scared of heights so it was easier to do one observatory vist. It worked really well. It was busy but everyone took turns and there were lots of beautiful photo opportunities.,5.0,4.8802
7544,Speechless view,"We had purchased the NYC Explorer pass, which included Empire State Building. We had heard a lot about the security and elevator lines from everyone. We were visiting the building on a Saturday so we had assumed a waiting time of 2 hours before we could finally go up. We wanted to see the evening view of about 7:30PM so reached Empire State by 5PM. Surprisingly, there was NO waiting and we reached on the 86th floor in 10 minutes! So its not predictable but mostly there is a long line, so count atleast 1 hour of waiting. The views were SO good and out of the world. Great experience overall.",5.0,4.877
7545,Empire State Building,"This is a lovely trip to do with some amazing views from the 2 levels up the tower. The only downside I feel is the cost of the visit for what you do, but saying that it is worth doing.",3.0,4.3716
7546,Visit to NY,"My Mum and I came to visit the Empire state building whilst staying at the Gallivant times square.
We used Gray Line hoppa tour bus and it took a good 30 minutes to get to the stop.
Not much of a queue we went early.
Two lifts you take to get to the top and they make sure the lift is not crowded which I liked.
On the top you see the breathtaking views of NY.
You see alot and old pictures of the guys who built the magnificent building.
When you finish back down you can buy a drink or a snack and go through to the soveriere shop if you want to buy something.
Over all a nice visit.
People say its better to visit at night time.
Glad we never this was the day they had the black out so we wouldn't of seen anything.
Enjoy",4.0,4.9394
7547,Not worth,there was a Ridiculous cost 49.00 each person. There was no way to just go in and look around. Was told they will let you in on 5th but man on 5th sent you back to the area to pay. They seem led to push purchase of observation,1.0,2.1006
7548,No wait at 10:00 AM on a Sat,"Not sure if it’s me, but the last two times I’ve been to NYC and visited the Empire State, there’s been absolutely no lines. I see where there is potential for long lines. Being that it was the weekend following July 4th, I targeted a little earlier start, but we got there later than planned. I simply couldn’t believe that there was no line to speak of. Views were as good as I remember and our daughters loved it. Great start to a day in NYC.",5.0,4.7434
7549,Nice View,"A very good experience if you are in NYC, you must experience Empire State Building but DO NOT BUY Express Entrance, still the same.

7576,Limited crowd control made for a poor experience,"The views are spectacular but there were so many people up there that we had to walk up 6 floors to get to the viewing platform to avoid a half hour wait for a lift and when got there it was rammed about 6 deep. We were then held there for about 20 minutes until we were allowed to queue for the lift down.

7581,Breathtaking Views,"I had already booked and paid for my tickets through GetYourGuide so I was able to enter the Empire State Building and walk straight on through. There are photo opportunities before you even get into the lift to go up to the 86th floor but it does become quite busy and people tend not to queue - it's basically a free-for-all. I arrived at 8am and there were a small amount of people queuing outside but once the doors opened many people rushed to the lifts. As there was a handful of people already there I took my time, got my photo, and took a leisurely stroll to security. The security there were friendly but gave no direction as to what had to be placed in the tray - I was unsure whether phones supposed to be separated from bags and what was permitted as well as what wasn't. Either way I made it through security, got a professional photo done and then made my way to the lifts which took you up to the 84th floor - while walking along this floor there is a wide range of information regarding The Empire State Building. This information includes when it was completed as well as the design for the building when it was being planned. There's also references to The King Kong movies throughout the years, with the posters featuring King Kong on The Empire State Building.

From there there's the main lift you need to take, which takes you to the 84th floor. Staff try to put a reasonable amount of people in each lift but in the heat can make it very sweaty and soon unbearably hot. Although I understand why the staff do this as that want to cut the queue times as well as allowing a steady flow of people up to the 84th floor. Although during this short ride, which takes around 30 seconds to a minute, there's a video that plays on the ceiling of the lift which looks so realistic and adds an element of enjoyment to a standard ride. Once you get to the floor you'll be ushered towards the many exits onto platform to enjoy the view. The views are simply breathtaking - there's no other way to say it. It's incredible to see such an enormous city from a view that makes everything seem so small and peaceful.

Even though I got there super early, when it first opened, it began to become busy by around 9am as there were a range of families and schools visiting. People will take up a lot of space when taking pictures and some people can become very rude if you get in their area while they're taking a picture. Take your picture and then make space for other people to do the same - you don't need 102 photos of you doing the same pose! Additionally parents will push their kids in front of you so they can get a better view - just be prepared to wait if you visit during a busier period such as midday or late afternoon as well as visiting for sunset. The gift shop is moderately priced and you can buy professional photos which are printed and digitally downloaded via a website for $18 (per print).",5.0,4.9878

7585,Lived up to all our expectations and more,"Visited here with my son in July. Arrived early morning so missed the queues and we were in quite quickly.

7587,Wonderful sunset views,"We went at 8pm to catch the sunset from the top. Beautiful views and so glad we did. It was annoying to have some people who were sitting on the edge looking inward at their phones and hogging the space for others to appreciate it. Was extremely busy up there too, but you just have to be patient to wait for a space or ask to move if they have been there a long time.

7594,Great experience even for those who respect heights,"I must echo what others suggest and plan to experience the Empire State Building on a weekday morning. Taking this suggestion, we saved the trip until the morning of our departure and arrived around 9 am of the suggested 8-10 am window. Within 10 minutes we were taking in the sights from the 86th floor of this classic skyscraper. We barely had any waits for elevators or chances to see the sights.

Now my son and I don’t like heights. The 30th floor of our hotel was pretty high - on the observation deck we were 3x higher. Ugh. But, the glasses in observation area gave us time to adjust before trying to step outside. The smaller crowds during the early morning also helped keep down any pressure.

Last note - the observation deck experience is expensive. We paid about $130 for 3 adult and one kid ticket.",5.0,3.2308
7595,Great Experience and no lines (go early),"Had a great time visiting the Empire State Building. We went right for opening which meant no long lines and we didn't need to pay for the express passes. Everyone working at the building were very friendly and welcoming. We went on a super clear morning and could see everything. The only issue was the steep cost of tickets. A family of 4 was $216 Canadian. Compared to the CN Tower at $149 Canadian, I think you get much more of an experience from the CN Tower. Minor complaint as it is a great thing to see in person.",5.0,4.9198

7621,They Took Away My Tripod,"I'm an amateur photographer, and was looking for a place to try to photograph some great views of the city. The Empire State Building seemed like a great choice, so I booked tickets several months in advance of my visit to NYC. Nowhere on their ticketing / booking site did it say I was not going to be permitted to bring my small travel tripod to the observation deck, however when I arrived at the security check point at the bottom of the building they took away my tripod (it's a small carbon fiber one - about the size of a liter bottle all folded up) saying ""it's a security concern"" and ""this is a private building"". They let me bring my camera up, but I specifically went at night so I could photograph the lights of the city... and without a tripod, my visit was a complete waste of my time and entrance fee.

The views are nice, and I really would have loved to be able to capture them for myself.

The entire experience left a really sour taste in my mouth: tickets are expensive, the lines are horrible, it's obvious that the entire operation is geared towards getting you into the gift shop where you will hopefully spend a bunch of money on pictures of the view you just saw but could not capture yourself because they took away your tripod.

When I asked security how many tripods they had to take away every day the response was ""Lots!"".

I get it - the building wants to make as much money off tourists as possible, but if you are going to take away my tripod hoping I'll buy a print from your gift shop, you should make it very clear when purchasing tickets in the first place that tripods are not permitted. I'll never go back, and next time I'm in NYC I'll do a bunch more research to see where I can photograph the city without getting my equipment confiscated.

If you do show up with a tripod, you can pick it up in the (drumroll....) gift shop after you return from the top.",1.0,4.979
7622,Beautiful Visit,Took my 6 year old grandson to New York City for his birthday. His highlights were the Empire State Building and the Statue of Liberty.

7626,A must in New York,Nice visit you must not miss. Friendly staff. Practical facilities. Easy to visit even when crowded.,5.0,4.0896
7627,Worth it,"Go early in the morning if you do not have pre-purchased tickets. We did this because we were using the New York Pass (and couldn't pre-purchase tickets). Walked straight onto an elevator. By the time we were leaving, lines were curling around already.",4.0,3.4526
7628,Fun touristy thing to do in NYC!,"Every time we go to New York, I say “we should go to the Empire State building“. We finally did on this trip, and it was fantastic. We sprung for the express line, as it was a very hot day and we did not want to be standing around... totally worth it! The views are amazing & all of the staff that works there are extremely nice!",5.0,4.8386
7629,Has to be done !,"This is one iconic NYC building that you have to visit. We experienced the following but didn't manage to film it... so top tip.. when you get in one of the lifts / elevators to go to the observation platform get your camera ready to film the ceiling of the lift ! whilst travelling upwards at speed the ceiling displays a display that mimics travelling to the top during construction of the tower, passing workers sat on girders etc. Enjoy the sights from the top.",5.0,4.9032
7630,Magnificent views,We had a couple of hours to spare before returning home and decided to catch the lifts up to the observatory deck. It was a sunny clear day and the views were spectacular. it was mid morning and the queues were a lot less than I had expected which made it all the more an enjoyable experience,4.0,4.6428
7631,First visit up the Empire,This was our first visit to New York and had to include a trip up the Empire State. We had read a number of reviews before hand and so as recommended by many pre-booked our tickets for the day we were going and also went in the evening (9pm US time).. Have to say the views at nights with all the lights were amazing and the queus were non existing.... Loved every minute...,5.0,4.8456
7632,New York trip,Used our City Pass tickets here . Very much worth a visit . Small queue for us on our visit . Views spectacular.,5.0,3.5822000000000003
7633,Worthwhile visiting,"It’s an iconic site and must be visited really...mainly because when you get home people will say “did you go to the Empire State!!”
Decent views, expensive though compared to the Chicago and LA tall buildings I have visited, but as I said earlier iconic and classic art deco makes up for it.",4.0,3.0
7634,Greats views,"It's a you expect.
Great views of the city and more.
Nicely run by polite but efficient staff.
Great first attraction I would say.",5.0,4.9168

7636,Empire State building observatory Review,Great experience watching the spectacular view of new York City from the top. Seeing skycrapers from the top was just awesome and the marvelous and ravishing lights was an apple to the eyes.,5.0,4.8806
7637,Very Cool,"Lines weren't too long. Nice views. I'd recommend going at night. The pictures up there do not turn out well though. Awesome facts and things to read on your way up there. Well-dressed employees and a cool, big gift shop (but pretty pricey)! Don't get New York key chains/other things like that from there, you're better off just going to a small store that sells them for a cheaper price.",5.0,4.8962
7638,Have to go,"A very good experience, and we didn't problemas with lines, ticketing and elevators.
Who is going to NYC, must go to Empire State Building.",4.0,3.9854000000000003
7639,A good evening experience,"We deliberately timed our visit till after sundown. It was pleasantly warm outside, the city lights were amazing and there was not much waiting in the standard line at 8:30PM on a Wednesday. I could not stomach the extra cost of express entry (+$33 per ticket) but when you consider the long exit through the gift shop at the end, this makes more sense. Management is very clearly into maximizing their profits. I am not cheap either - I paid for a full membership to the 911 Museum to get express entry, plus got the ""All-inclusive"" tickets for the Freedom Tower observation deck. Even those were only $20 more than the standard / GA tickets. We used the money that we saved by getting ESB standard tickets for taxi fare and still had about $30 left over.

My only complaint about the Main Deck is that it's cramped. There are a lot of people up there and so it's a free-for-all to get a good view. At times, I had to press my legs against the wall as some parents allowed their little kids to wedge themselves in that space. Considering the age and history of the building though, this is an experience that shouldn't be missed.",5.0,4.9681999999999995
7640,Our choice was the Empire State Building and it was a good choice,"If you do have limited time in NYC and you would like to do at least one of the observatory platform, you need to decided which one and I believe there is no right or wrong. It's totally up to you. I picked the ESB while the rest of my family was never at NYC before and the hotel was close by. We actually even purchased the Skip the line tickets while haven two young children with us and, as mentioned, we only had limited time in NYC to see as much as possible. It would not have been necessary for this time of the year but it wasn't bad neither. Everybody enjoyed their time and we were glad that we picked the ESB, next time we will try another sky scraper in order to compare.",4.0,3.6894
7641,Beautiful Building,"It’s been a while since I visited the Empire State Building. They have a new observatory entrance and there are lots of photo opportunities when you line up to buy tickets.

We went Sunday afternoon around 3pm and there were no lines. Going up is a breeze.

Empire State is one of the most beautiful building in Manhattan.",5.0,4.3602
7642,Great on a clear day,"We were lucky to have a sunny day to go up and observe the scenery as you have to purchase tickets ahead of time like many tourist attractions in NYC. There is lots of room to move around and get great shots in all directions.

The elevator ride is extremely quick and you cannot even feel yourself moving. On the way up, there is a video on the ceiling showing you move through the construction of the elevator.

There is indoor and outdoor viewing.

It is very expensive; about $36/person just to go up the elevator. Then, of course, there is a fairly large gift shop on the way out with reasonable prices. It would be good to have more King Kong paraphernalia.",4.0,4.9256
7643,Must see,"Very interesting building, historically as well as for enjoying the great view. Very friendly staff. Be there early, as it gets crowded very fast.",5.0,4.888

7646,Great,We had a pre booked voucher. We didn't have to wait too long to get up to the top. We went in the evening as last time we did this we did it during the day. Amazing views.,5.0,4.3616
7647,Great!,"Fast service to get to the top and friendly staff. Fabulous view! Love the bit in the elevator, which was a nice touch!",4.0,4.8862000000000005
7648,Trip to New York City,When visiting New York a trip to the top of the Empire State Building is a must. The views from the observation deck are breathtaking. Internally also the building is a work of art. We were among the early arrivals which I'd recommend before it gets too busy.,5.0,4.486
7649,Just what you expect,A great view for a moderate price. The screening process has greatly improved and getting in and out is pretty easy.,5.0,4.8546

7652,Best views....,"What can you say really? It’s the Empire State Building!
Lived up to all my expectations. The Art Deco architecture is immaculate. Views are amazing. Not too crowded and very organised. Got all the photos I needed.
The walls of historical information, illustrations and photos were fascinating.",5.0,4.6442
7653,beautiful view,"beautiful view in the fresh air. I recommend to all. I have a comparison with the OWTC and although this building is older, it is comparatively good",5.0,4.782
7654,Great experience - waiting line absolutely OK,Awesome view. Line was not very long with normal Tickets. Very easy to buy tickets there at the online kiosks.,4.0,4.614
7655,Top of the city,"Entrance was very well organized. We went at sunset and the line moved quickly. I see no reason to purchase tickets in advance.The outside area was very crowded on the Western side do to sunset. If you have young children, or are short, it will be difficult to see. Once people had a spot they did not share. The view after dark is amazing. Going at dusk gives you both views.Keep in mind, if you can't see the top from the ground,it will be too cloudy to have a view.
When you go at this time, many people are wanting to leave at the same time, so the decent can take a while. If you are able to do stairs you have an option to walk down to floor 79 and get an elevator from there. 156 steps s involved and it is not difficult if you are mobile.",4.0,2.2014
7656,Honeymoon in New York,"It's amazing this building and all de city, and the views is very very beatiful, but I think a lot of people I think if the people will have book hour it will be better.",5.0,4.4782
7657,Favourite visit of our trip,"We got there for about 9.30 and the queue was minimal
We checked the weather and knew if would be a clear day
The whole experience was amazing, it got busier as we were there",5.0,4.5012
7658,Empire State building,So we arrived early and there were no queues at all and it was great to go straight up and have only a few people sharing it. Pity that we had purchased the fast pass tickets therefore. Also think they should tell you the top floor observatory is out of commission before you buy. Great views from it and the decor inside is as iconic as the building outside.,3.0,4.7668
7659,Best To visit during clear weather,"I first visited ESB over 25 years ago . Then it was free to enter and you didn’t experience long queue times. Last year I visited the rock and both my daughter and I loved it. If it’s all about the photos , the rock has clear 360 views of the Manhattan skyline . Visited ESB again last week after waiting 25 years and I was sadly disappointed . The customer service was excellent and perhaps our experience was ruined due to the gloomy clouds overhead and rain however I forgot just how much the caged fence surrounding most of the area obstructs your views. It was still nice to pay a nostalgic visit but the rock will be my go to for views and photos .",3.0,3.9708
7660,ICONIC MUST VISIT,Visited late afternoon in hopes of staying till dark but too many people to really move around and have time to see out like I really wanted to.,4.0,4.2620000000000005

7662,Return visit to NYC and this historic landmark,"On this our return visit to NYC, we stayed at a hotel on 38th which is not far from this iconic building.

Hoards of crowds, half hour wait for the two separate lifts you have to take (we chose to walk instead of queue for the last one which isn’t much fun). At the top the crowds are 4-5 rows deep cramped into the narrow viewing gallery. We also went up the Rockerfeller centre which has genuinely interesting placard re its history, a short film, and at top the view is much better and there are lots of different viewing spaces so you aren’t all cramped in.",1.0,4.604

7703,Amazing view of a colourful city,"Great to get up high and see the city of New York from a different perspective, there is so much variety you don’t get from the streets.
I didn’t have trouble with lines, don’t know if this is unusual. No rush once at the observation desk, l wondered around for over half an hour seeing something different each time l stopped to take in the view. Great view of the Chrysler Building",4.0,4.0534
7704,Anti-Tourist Turncoat,"For year's I've identified myself as an ""anti-tourist."" Save for a few things here and there, I try my best to seem as little like a tourist as I can--not that there's anything wrong with tourists and what they're attracted to. I just don't like to be robbed of the actual culture of a destination and have a glitzy or phony stand in its place.
The Empire State Building was one of these attractions that I failed to resist. Where a lot of attractions can be summarily written off as actually being less than what the idea of them imply, this building could not be written off in such a way. The idea of this monument of a building is legendary, and observing the city from so close to the Empire's peak is equally so, if not more.
Excitement builds mightily as you get close to the observatory on the 86th floor. Some of it is not due to any efforts by the staff or the building. Your ears pop, which likely hasn't happened since your plane landed. This indicates the elevation you'll be at, which then gets your heart racing. Where the efforts of those at the building come in is when they give you an entertaining perspective as to its construction, which is an utterly terrifying proposition.
Finally, the big payoff is exiting the elevator on the 86th floor. You step out, and as much as you anticipate the sight you will see, little will prepare you for the quiet, surreal view. As you step out of the glass enclosure and out into the open air, there is a slight ambiance from the ground. But the quiet from that height juxtaposed with the bustle on the ground gives you a soaring feeling, and for once in the great city of New York, you can scan everything. Take in everything. Imagine everything.
Once the stupor fades, a wave of excitement will pass over you to get back down and explore the nooks and crannies, some of which you could only see from that height, and others that you knew of that looked even better from the clouds. This building took an ""anti-tourist"" and turned him. I couldn't have been anymore impressed with this big time tourist attraction that I just could not avoid.",5.0,4.9696
7705,Upwardly superb experience,"The Empire State Building far exceeded our expectations, even though I’m not at my best hundreds of feed in the air I enjoyed the experience with great awe and marvel of a truly magnificent city",5.0,4.8556

We were lucky, arrived early and there were no queues, so from ticket to top was less than ten minutes.

You take the first ride in the elevator to the first inside view point and it was amazing, then you take the second elevator for the final seven floors to the outside view point.

People were pushing each other & although we have teenage sons we thought it was too much for our 8 year old daughter. We didn’t stay long which was a real shame.

Observatory is situated on 86th floor. Lift goes to 79th floor.
Then either change lift or steep walk up 7 floors.
Views as expected were amazing!!!
Also had free fixed binoculars around the platform.
After decent you enter the vast gift shop.
On entry photos in front of green screen are taken, which you can by there with you and friends/family projected on photo. 1 x copy expensive at $26 hence recommend the $36 version with 2 copies of different background and 5 different digital photos.
We had New York Pass, hence a no brainer to visit.",5.0,4.8568
7727,Empire State Building,A lot of fun. Was surprised at the cost ! As a child/ young adult it was far cheaper. $45+ for an adult and $40 for a preteens was expensive.,5.0,4.3392
7728,Great views,"Go early in the morning preferably on a weekday to get ahead of the queues. We walked down 7 flights of stairs to skip a half hour queue on the way down - which was so much quicker and nicer!
Beautiful 360 view of the city!",5.0,4.6236
7729,It will take your breath away.,The excitement you feel on the way to the top is undescribable until you step out of that elevator and see for yourself what it feels like to be on top of the world the buildings the bridges rooftops and it’s all yours for the taking,5.0,4.6148

7732,What an experience !!,I am one of those luckiest to have the opportunity to visit this landmark. Empire State Building is one of iconic sky scrapers in the world.,4.0,4.59
7733,Empire State Building : amazing !,"The visit of the Empire State Building was an amazing experience!
I went there with my family, and thanks to the NY City Pass we visited twice : one during the day, and one by night...!
I recommand that activity!!!",5.0,4.6692
7734,"Second visit, always a pleasure","I first visited in 2017 on a school trip to NYC after dark and couldn't really see much apart from the lights of other buildings so when I went back for my 18th I wanted to see the view during the day. We booked the tickets online a few hours before in case there were ticket queues since the ESB is one of the biggest attractions in Manhattan, although, there were no queues when we showed up at 3pm. Architecturally speaking, the Empire State Building is my favourite amongst the Manhattan skyline, however, the view is not. Don't get me wrong, the views are amazing as you get a clear view of the East River and other sites such as the Chrysler Building and even the Flat Iron Building, personally I just prefer the view from the Top of the Rock.

Also, the binoculars are free so you can get a clear view of the WTC and Chrysler building using them.

The gift shop was quite expensive for some things but knowing that I would most likely not be back, for a while at least, I purchased a decent-sized bronze statue of the building for only $30, I can't help loving the design of the building.

Overall, it's a must when visiting NYC and I wouldn't miss it.",5.0,3.9661999999999997
7735,Breathtaking views,"We had a great visit to the Empire State Building. Lines moved quickly, and we were able to get up to the top to see the sights. The views are breathtaking!",5.0,4.6956
7736,Overpriced Experience,"I’m from Texas and went to multiple attractions for my first time in NY. Went up to the 79th and 86th floor. It’s $40. For someone who isn’t a “history buff” or doesn’t care about the history and just wanted to see this height, $40 was too much. We were in and out in 20 minutes. Statue of Liberty was $18.50 and we got on a ferry and saw 2 places. Statue of Liberty and Ellis island. Both cooler than looking over the side of a building. Save your money if it’s your first time. $30 is much more reasonable. Honestly $20",2.0,4.92
7737,Amazing,The building is incredible!! The visit is obligatory if you travel to NYC. The employees are very nice. I recomend it.,5.0,4.1372
7738,Star of New York,Empire State Building is the most popular and beautiful building for me. The visit was fast but sufficient.,5.0,4.123
7739,Evening visit.,"NYC has so many high rise tourist viewing platforms now that although this is an iconic attraction and probably one that you need to tick off your bucket list, it isn't the best. I feel its a bit dated now, but very well organised and again staffed by a really nice team.",3.0,4.5864
7740,Iconic visit did not disappoint,"Our visit was better than expected...we thought it might one of those disappointments of ""just like the photos"". It is breath-taking to view from every side of the building observation deck; and the architecture and history are part of the interesting visit. Take the obligatory photo of yourself at the top...it is spectacular. Do not miss ---- the unique experience of the video shown on the ceiling of the elevator as it goes up to the top. DO order your tickets online in advance to avoid waiting in line. Impressive lobby, friendly staff dressed in uniforms which remind you of scenes from the movies.",5.0,4.7888

7743,Expensive experience,I would like to share with you that the visit in ESB is too expensive. US$ 56 / ADULT and US$ 30 / child. Besides they want to sell one picture by US$20 as a remembering. Its prices are too abusive. There are many places in NYC cheaper and more interesting. I hope the managers think about to reduce prices and transform this experience more pleasuring.,2.0,4.7538
7744,Awesome!!!,"The first thing we did the first time we travelled to NYC. We were lucky and had a really clear night for it. Truly amazing, expensive but so is everything in the big apple 🤣❤️🇺🇸",5.0,4.4698
7745,Good but,"The only thing that threw me off was that they stop randomly on the 80-somethingith floor, and then put you on another elevator to the top. We went at night and it was lovely, a lot of people even then, so hard to get some good pictures.",4.0,4.3268

Walk to the North Side and view across Harlem to upstate NY. East, the East River and the other boroughs. South, the Freedom Tower and Harbor, and West, the Hudson and NJ. The wind blows and you can just imagine King Kong there beside you, fighting off the fighter jets. You will wait in line, but it is worth it. Get yourself a memento in the gift shop once you are done to remind you and everyone else that you have been one of the millions that have had the privilege to view the world from its most famous building.",4.0,4.8962
7748,Amazing - Didn't Disappoint !!!,"A visit to New York wouldn't have been complete without a visit to the top of this iconic building.
Airport type security on entering - staff polite and helpful. Spotlessly clean - black marble and gold art deco interior - fast lift/elevator service and stunning views from the top! Stay up as long as you wish - to enjoy the experience. Highly recommended.",5.0,4.9212
7749,Disappointing,"The queue on the way up was short and moved quickly. The first level you visit had very little in the way of exhibition material, just a few images. The next level up with the 360 views and open air balcony was jam packed and you couldn’t get near the outside to take a photo. It was also hard moving round due to the crowds and I was glad to leave. Not worth the considerable ticket price.",2.0,3.3724

7760,Great views if you don’t mind waiting,"Went here in the evening as we thought it would be less crowded, and we’d already done Rockefeller center during the day. How wrong could we have been. Although the queueing went smoothly and we got to the 86 floor without too much delay when we exited the lift onto the floor the amount of people really surprised me. Just making your way around the outside took forever as people just stopped and blocked the walk way. Talking decent photos took a while as you waited your turn to get to the front. Views are undoubtedly amazing, especially at night when the city lights up. Well worth doing in the evening as everywhere looks completely different. Just be patient 👍",4.0,3.6166
7761,Most beautiful view,Our visit was awesome! We went up at sunset and then saw the beautiful view of New York at night. I even cried a little when we left.,5.0,4.5424

I'm from Long Island and used to come in the city many times when I was younger and visit the ESB for a less than a 1/4 of what I paid now. I feel at least kids should be half of the adult price.However, It was a great experience to have for my boys.",5.0,4.53

7767,"Overpriced, but fantastic views.","I'm divided on this one because the views are amazing, but I think they could give you more for your money. There is very little to look at while you wait and I expected some decent decor to look at, which I didn't get. A bucket list tick, but a pricey one.",4.0,3.68

7780,Good view but very crowded,"We decided to go to the Empire State Building before sunset so that we could try to avoid the crowd that would be there for sunset. When we got up, it was extremely crowded and no one would move from a spot at the railings. You would have to wait about an hour until you got a spot against the railing, if you were lucky enough to get there first. People would do timelapses of the sunset or just stand there so you wouldn’t be able to get to the front. It was nearly impossible to get a picture without the side of anyone’s head or arm in it. Once you do get a spot the view of NYC is pretty. I would suggest going to the observatory, but during the day where it may not be as busy (I’m not sure I’ve never been during the day). You also get to read some interesting stuff about the Empire State Building along the way and see the inside.",3.0,3.8334

7833,Not very fun,The construction really put a damper on our visit. the staff was rude and the 86th floor was smaller due to constriction. should have waited to go,2.0,2.0824
7834,Express VIP tickets are great,"Took my niece and nephew to NYC for. Few days. We hit the major sites including ESB. We wanted to do as much as possible so waiting in huge lines was not on our agenda. We decided to splurge and buy express tix, which is 2-3x the normal ticket price. We were able to take in the Central Park zoo and other sites and then head to the ESB later in the day. We zipped past all lines and were at the 86th floor in minutes!! We even got express service going down as well, which I was surprised was included. We saved a good three hours waiting in line. With two kids in tow it saved my sanity and was worth the extra money.",5.0,4.8774
7835,AMAZING VIEWS,5* views from the top of the empire state building!! Seeing the whole of the New York skyline. Is breath taking,5.0,3.673
7836,"Nice experience, well oiled machine!","I am from New York, and had never been to the Empire State Building. We had family visit from Poland, and this was on their list of things to see.

I anticipated long lines. But I was wrong! It was about a 5 minute walk from Penn Station. We got there at about 11am. Everything went so quick! We bought our tickets when we arrived ($41 pp). You purchase them on a computer when you get there. If you purchase in advance, they are $36 pp.

Once we got our tickets we went through security, got on the elevator, and headed on up. They have a lot if workers manning the elevators and instructing you where to go and what to do.

It was such a nice experience! Hard to get a picture without strangers, but that’s ok.",5.0,4.3866
7837,3. time opp there- but it isn't no fun any more!,"After one hour in line you maybe are lucky for coming up and out on the platform.Then you have a lot of groups with special tickets - ""Skip the line""- tickets! This is very frustrating because the cost for a normal ticket is nearly the same like a one day salary, but it's not good enough for going up after (your) a queue number! It's very crowded on the platform too, after some waiting you will still get some beautiful views and pics.
Yes, pics! - the Empire State Comp. makes pics too, for you and with you - just have a look! Well, here nearly goes your next day salary for this pic! (ok, I'm a senior :))
Apropos senior! - have some $ in cash or you have to skip the bathroom! :)",3.0,4.9098
7838,Pricey with a priceless view,"The view from the top of this iconic building is worth it alone however, the museum has lots of little bits of interesting information and pictures. We were so lucky there was no queue to get to the top at midday on a Monday. In the space of 10 minutes we had tickets, got through security and had two elevator rides to the top where the crowd was small enough to get a front row view from each vantage point.
The ticket price of $40 per person was steep but still similar to that of other New York City attractions.",4.0,4.6784
7839,"Let's face it, this is a must do in NYC.",Expensive but as one of the city's major attractions it's a must do. My family visited at 3pm on a Friday afternoon in July and there was almost no queues so don't waste money on buying an express or jump-the-queue ticket without seeing for yourself if they are necessary. We loved the views of Manhattan and surrounding boroughs and were surprised that the numerous telescopes around the viewing platform were free to use. Recommended.,4.0,4.9286
7840,Empire State Bldg July 3rd,Totally overpriced and disappointing. Spent over $100. with entrance fees and parking. Total of 2 elevator rides and approx. 10 minutes of city views is hardly worth that kind of price. Will not be returning nor recommending it to anyone.,1.0,2.1353999999999997
7841,BUCKET LIST WAY TO SEE NEW YORK CITY AFTER WALKING AROUND ALL DAY,We did this after walking for many hours downtown New York. The wait was not long at all for this day and we were able to get our tickets and move on through the line really quick. IT is up 86 flights for the elevator - and it moves smooth and fast. There is narration going up of how it was built. IT is $40 per person for the way we did it. You can stay on top as long as you wish. There are bathrooms when you get back down and a great souvenier shop. IT is hard to find bathrooms downtown so use this one before you leave - nice and clean.,5.0,4.744
7842,always a must see,"I traveled with 2 type one diabetics and getting through the security was stressful. It would be nice if employees who work in these very popular, iconic representations of our fine country would be more friendly and understanding of special needs.",4.0,4.7996
7843,The icon of NY.,Don’t miss this icon! You can purchase tickets online with an additional purchase to skip waiting in line. So worth it. Go and watch the aunt set. It’s spectacular!,5.0,3.5816
7844,Go early!,"We visited a half hour after the building opened, and there was no line to get in. We had a NYC Explorer pass so we didn't have to stop to buy a ticket. The staff were friendly and helpful in directing us where to go to get to the elevators. There's a lot of interesting art on the walls as you weave through the lines.

You ride up in a group of 20 or so up to the first stop which is enclosed in glass but provides a 360 degree view of the city. You can stay there as long as you want taking pictures before you get in line to ride up to the 84th floor. That takes you to the outside observation deck which is incredibly scenic.

It wasn't as breezy or cold as I expected. We hung out up there for about an hour taking pictures and looking at the views from every angle. It was more crowded up there, but you were still able to get a good view. Afterward, you ride down to the bottom and can browse the gift shop before you leave. The gift shop is unsurprisingly pricey, but they have a lot of cute merchandise. I would definitely recommend.",5.0,4.9622
7845,Great Views,"The views from the top of the Empire State building can not be beat. I wish the staff were more friendly and accommodating. We were kept in line for almost an hour after passing security with no offer of why. When we finally got across security to go up in the elevator, an attendant finally told us there was a private event they were clearing out. In the future, Empire staff, be a little more forthcoming. We were ignored when we asked why the delay and they were unapologetic about it. Not a great reflection of a great landmark.",5.0,1.7136

7847,Expensive open air view,"Being outside in the open air and there have a 360d-look over Manhatten - that's great and that's a great value. But in the same time: that's all. The presentation and the possibilities inside are rather poor and therefore the price is much too high. 1 $ for every floor - sounds funny, but isn't.",3.0,4.341

The staff were really kind, but at one point one member of staff asked me whether I was staying still opening as he needs to know so he can let people go for lunch, which just made me feel slightly uncomfortable to stay longer as it was clear he wanted me to go.",4.0,4.6926000000000005

7860,Great Second Visit (Day time),"We visited two years ago at night, and this time during the day, a beautiful, sunny day.

We got there around 10 am on 7/5 (the recommendation was before 9 am). There was a line but manageable - maybe around 10 minutes before we got on the elevator to 79th floor. At 79th floor, they opened the stairs to walk up/down between 79th and 86th floors - something we don’t recall from 2017. We saved time and got a workout (30 steps or so per floor?).

Only thing was I wished they wouldn’t yell at people who stop on the ramp to take photos. It was a different vantage point and we were not aware you couldn’t do that.",5.0,4.2856000000000005
7861,Amazing!!,One piece if advice is to get there early. The queues/lines can be around the street but getting there early we were in and at the lift in less than 10 mins. Amazing decor and very good exhibits showing the construction. Staff were very friendly and helpful. The view at the top is stunning. We had a perfect day weather wise and wow. A must for every trip to NYC just get there early.,5.0,4.9828
7862,"Nice view, Rockefeller is better, crowds can take away the fun.","My daughter and I went early July at around 10am. We got tickets online but here was no wait to speak of anyway despite a fair amount of people. Up on the 86th floor, it was pretty packed. I am fully aware that we were part of the crowd but we had a hard time finding a spot without people in front of us. If you go with kids, just keep in mind that--at least in my experience--people care more about their selfies than kids that aren't tall enough yet to get a good view from the second row.
I have been on the Empire State and the Rockefeller multiple times and like the Rockefeller better, mainly because you see the Empire State Building dominating the skyline so beautifully.",3.0,4.9323999999999995

7867,Excellent Trip up the Empire State Building,"I do suggest you get there early to avoid the queues. We went at 08:15 and there were no queues at all and the viewing platforms were easy to move about on.
Even if you get a ""skip the queue"" ticket it only gets you up the ESB quicker - the viewing platforms will still be busy.

So go early - its is definitely worth it - a great experience.",5.0,4.604
7868,Beautiful Building with Great Views,Too hot to stand in queues so it was worth paying extra to Skip the Line. On the upward trip the lift gives an overhead video of the construction of the building at a time before Health and Safety were invented! View from the top was breathtaking and it was easy to pick out the famous landmarks. I am usually scared of heights but felt comfortable at the Observatory. The interior of the building is classically beautiful so take time on the descent to look at the corridors. One of the highlights of the holiday.,5.0,4.9228000000000005
7869,Wonderful views,We visited during daytime on a great sunny day. We wanted to see New York from the iconic State Building and the views were fantastic and you could spend hours picking out the most popular attractions and buildings.,5.0,4.8982
7870,OK but not all that,"We had previously been to New York some years ago and been up the Empire States Building during the day, this time we thought we'd try it at night; this was around half nine. The staff are friendly and helpful and let us skip much of the queuing as my father is in a wheelchair. The building is wheelchair accessible, there doesn't seem to be any part that's off limits to disabled people. The only real disappointment is the shear volume of people up at the observation deck. It's so crowded you have to wait ages for a space to look out properly and it was a nightmare getting my dad around so he could see all the viewpoints. There seems to be some renovation work going on, as some parts were really narrow, I can't remember it being that narrow last time; perhaps when this is completed the crowding will improve. As you leave the building you are taken on a route through the gift shop. Pricey, like most shops of it's kind, but a large variety of objects to choose from.",2.0,4.53
7871,Observation,The views are really spectacular from the 86th floor! The building is beautiful inside and out and it’s in a great location!,5.0,4.7238
7872,Well organised and a good experience,This was a good experience. The lines moved quickly and the staff were very well organised. The views were spectacular and it is situated very centrally.,5.0,4.2956
7873,A must visit in NYC,Absolutely amazing views of NYC. Better than Liberty Tower simply because it's in the center of Manhattan.,5.0,4.7716
7874,Skip The Line is Worth It!,"My niece and I travelled to NYC for her 17th birthday. One of her top excursions was the Empire State Building observatory but our flight was delayed by 5 hours. Due to other events scheduled I was worried that we wouldn't be able to use our tickets. We decided to give it a try and though it took a minute to find what they needed to confirm the tickets we were immediately escorted past everyone to an express elevator where we were again moved in front of the line. We NEVER had to wait for anything and the lines were long! We had plenty of time at the top and our timing was perfect because we made it up just in time for sunset.

I will say that unless you are REALLY set on being at the top for sunset, it was VERY crowded. I’ve been up there a number of times prior, both during the day and at night. I recommend the daytime if you would like less crowds.

But again, I highly recommend the Skip the Line passes.",5.0,4.89
7875,Stunning interior even before you reach the top,"The fun starts as soon as you enter the empire state building.
Beautifully decorated throughout.
Staff are very helpful along the whole all the way to the top.
Lots of memorabilia on the wall from when the building was being erected to all the celebrities that have visited.

Elevator ride was fun and there's 2 observation decks that you can view from.

Once you get to the top you'll realise why king Kong climbed this building.

Amazing views !!!",5.0,4.9338
7876,Great views! Classic highlight of NY,"There was no line up to go to the Empire State Building. We had our city pass that we bought for this site seeing trip so we did not have to wait in a line (if there was one) to buy a ticket.
There was a person dressed up like King King that worked there so you or your kids could take pictures. They changed the elevator ride to the top which was cool. When you enter a video will play on the roof like you can see outside as you move up.
The views at the top are great. Lots of opportunities to take pictures and to hang out on a clear day.",5.0,4.909
7877,Amazing views!,We went to the Empire State Building on our last night in New York at around 8pm to see the lights at night. We were expecting queues and long waiting times but when we got there the staff suggested we leave as it was too foggy to see anything. We went up regardless and along with 5 others max we looked out at the fog for approximately 10 minutes until the wind was in our favor and cleared the fog giving us a beautiful view over looking the lights! It was the most beautiful sight to end our dream holiday,5.0,4.9552
7878,Don't miss this!,"We came at around 7:30 pm, with Tickets bought in advance. Some queing för the security control and elevators, but less than we'd expected. As we came out on the Platform, it was still daylight. But soon the sun started setting and that's when the magic started. The whole City literally lighted up before us! Marvellous. It really us something special, the view from up there, over Manhattan, the rivers and the boroughs.",5.0,4.4258
7879,Worth doing,"This tour is one of those you have to do when traveling to New York. Not because it is awesome, just because it is the Empire State Building! It is way up there and as advertised, it takes no time to make it to the top! The views are beautiful for sure, but after a while, it all looks the same to me. The Eiffel tower was more impressive for sure but I will recommend that venue to any one visiting New York. They are selling all sorts of thing on your way out, but they are not pushy if you dont care to purchase any souvenir from your tour. I also like that it is not really guided. Once at the top, you go wherever and for however long you care to stay.",4.0,4.902

The staff could not provide us with an exact duplicate experience, but worked with us to exchange for standard weekend passes. All the staff at this site were very helpful and friendly, a pleasure to interact with. Wish we had known about the Skyscraper Museum (different site) before we arrived, but still enjoyed all the historic material available to read. The outdoor viewing is spectacular! Spent more time there than expected. Nice gift shop after the experience.",4.0,4.9702
7886,Just do it!!,Another one of those places that you have to visit if you're ever in New York City. How can you not? It's iconic and is world known. It's a landmark that is visible from just about anywhere in the city. It helps you know where you are when you're not sure by just looking around and spotting it towering over the other buildings. And then there is the view. What a view! You can see for miles and miles and get a great perspective of the city and surrounding areas. Don't pass it up. Just do it!!,5.0,4.5708

7891,One of the best ways to get an aerial view of New York.,"It May not be the tallest building in New York, but it is the most iconic, and if there was a choice between Empre State Building and One World observatory (which I also did), I would do the Empire State. It is a classical building, and one where you can have the wind on your face and in your hair. You truly feel you are at altitude on the 86th floor.",5.0,4.1854
7892,Wonderful Experience,"Let me start by saying, the 4th of July is one of the best times to visit NYC. We began going this time the last few years and it is great because most everyone leaves the city for this holiday - heading to the Jersey Shore and other beach locations. We visited the Empire State Building on July 3rd and got there at 8:00 am. We walked right in and had no lines at any point. It was a beautiful day and very comfortable on the top level. We did splurge for the VIP Express but if you got at this time, you don't need it. When we were leaving around 10:00, the lines were significantly longer but still very reasonable. There is an App you can download that has audio you can listen to which explains what are you are looking at out each side of the building. We didn't know this, but others seemed to enjoy it. Would highly recommend it. The prices in the gift shop were surprisingly affordable too.",5.0,4.9594000000000005

7895,Beautiful iconic Empire State building,"Full disclosure: we reached the ticket area and bailed, as my friend and travel companion has a fear of heights. Given the price tag, we didn't feel it worth chancing that she would want to go down right away.

Having been to the Top of the Rock on my last trip, that was fine with me.

It was still amazing to see the building and be in its lobby. We even took the chance to pose with the small scale Empire State building on the ground floor.

7916,Cannot Miss This,"Whether you are traveling to the Big Apple for the first time, or you have been before and just haven’t made it yet, you MUST go to the Empire State Building. Yes the tickets are a bit pricey compared to other things you could do, but it is 100% worth it. Amazing 360 degree views of the whole of New York City laid out before you, and if you go at night, you get an even more spectacular view of the city all lit up.",5.0,4.711
7917,Nice but overpriced,"We were four of us and when we saw the entrance price of 40 plus tax per person we decided to go only two of us.

7919,A must,"Of course we were told to visit ESB but this is really worth it.

It was a single ticket (no star and sun) and we decided to go there as soon as 8.00am.

A real pleasure when there is no waiting line, no one else than you when you get to this mythical 86th floor.

Night version may surely be worth it as well, but given no time can be booked in advance, to the contrary of the Top of the Rock, we didn't want to experience the unfinished lines...

Go and enjoy!",5.0,4.89
7920,Crowded,The view was great but employees need help with customer service skills. I was a little confused about where to go since we had pre-purchased tickets and the two gentlemen working the first floor acted liked questions were a huge bother. I enjoyed the views but it was crowded. We went on a Saturday afternoon.,3.0,4.8232

7922,More than I hoped for,"I got the ""skip the line"" tickets for myself and my boyfriend and they were WELL worth it. We didnt walk through the whole line where you see all the pictures and read the info, but as we didnt care much about that anyway and only cared about getting to the top to see the view, we were thrilled when we didnt have to wait in any line and got straight to the top. The view was even more breathtaking than I had expected and we did not want to go back down. That view of the city cant be beat. We did roughly 7 laps around the top, stopping to take in the views on each side. It was SO worth the money and I would absolutely do it again!!!",5.0,4.9262

The views were amazing, as it was Pride weekend lots of the buildings had the rainbow colours and you could see the end of the parade - that was running very late!

7935,Empire v Rockafeller,Whilst it was nice to say you had been to the top I would recommend people take the time to do the Rockafeller as the view from there is magnificent. You get the view of the Empire State Building and Central Park in one visit. The Empire State Building lacked visitor information to keep you occupied whilst queueing.

The lift is amazing as it has a moving graphic display on the ceiling making it look like the shaft is being built as you go up. We went early in the morning so we had an easy and swift transition. We had a clear day so the views from the top were brilliant. Defiantly need to put this onto your ""To do"" list. The exit foyer has a stunning 30's style and is a must for some great photos.....

We took an Uber from our hotel near Times Square and grabbed some pizza on the way. It was a little confusing to get into the building, but once inside the staff were great in helping navigate it. THEY were super friendly and a welcome change from the rudeness we had encountered all week in the city. They directed us, explained the building and even joked around with us. The top of the building was EXTREMELY crowded and while the views were stunning, the crowds took away from the overall experience. They should not have tours for large groups of school kids, or any other group at the same time as the general public...I questioned the safety of that many people at once. Oh, and be prepared to wait in long lines for the elevators and even the stairs. It was fun, the staff were awesome, but the crowds were a buzz kill.",3.0,4.9788
7952,Costly attraction,"Visit of Empire State Building is major attraction of New York for visitors but in my opinion, it cost too much for a family to go up to see the whole city from top but it is adventure for visitors so mostly planned it. In my opinion visit the building from ground and save money for Museums.",4.0,4.7745999999999995

We explained to our 8yo and 13yo before arriving to the building the history and some fun facts. They just loved the visit and we gave them as much time as they wanted to go through ALL the binoculars and take as many selfies as they wanted. It was a lot o fun specially for the 8 yo to see the streets below and the ""tiny people and cars"".... The lines to go up went fast and the personnel is always around to help you. Don´t miss this visit !!",5.0,4.9488
7960,World Pride Parade,"It was so wonderful to have the Empire State building as a backdrop for the world pride parade because the Empire State building is symbolic of progress, ingenuity, and stature.

7961,Kind of expensive,"As all of you know, th Empire State Building is one of the main atractions in NY City, my thoughts are that is kind of expensive, the basic entrence ticket is $43, If you wish to go higher the ticket price also goes higher
If you are a hights lover, architecture, buildings, etc. You will defenitly love it 🙌🏼 but if you are not I would recomend spending that money on museums, tours or anything you like.
Nevertheless the view is amazing",3.0,4.872

7963,Express Pass was awesome,"We visited Sat 29 June 2019 at around 11:00 AM. There are many lines, crossovers on floors etc to get to the top. We were only in New York for 3 days so time was precious. The express pass for following the redline was perfect. We were at the top in 10 minutes. Service was great and it is a site definitely worth seeing. We spent an hour taking in the views.",5.0,4.9164
7964,Beautiful,"This was my third visit. It had been a while since I'd been in the building. Since I'd last visited, the elevator process was significantly streamlined. It's currently under renovation again, but they go out of their way to make it unobtrusive. The view of course is why people go there and the way that the skyline changes with every passing year makes it worthy of return visits. The observation deck is a small space, and due to the historical nature of the building, there's nothing much that can be done about that. We visited on a Thursday afternoon and It was far less crowded than I've ever seen it; prior visits have been on a weekend afternoon and a weekday rather late at night. We barely waited anywhere at all. The staff of the building was helpful and kind. It was my mother's first visit and she's been gushing about it ever since. If you're out to do an iconic thing in new york city, this is the one to do.",5.0,4.8418

It it was not necessary because at the end of June, early morning, it was not crowded at all. We think they could organize better the line for the skip the line ticket. There’s no sign indicating where you need to be. When we return after visiting the top my husband had to look for some employee to ask where was the line for the skip the line tickets. In fact there was no line separating the guests, they just scream for you to enter in the elevator first.",3.0,4.4538

You’d think there might be some sort of restriction as to how many people are allowed to the top at a time perhaps. Also, other visitors were running up and down the stairs which made us feel kind of frightened as it almost felt like there was a panic happening. We actually thought the view was better from the Top of The Rock... which I think is because you can see the Empire State from there. It’s still an iconic building but we just felt too cramped.

To be fair, I have visited in the past when there were extensive queues so this was a gamble - but on this occasion it paid off.

Well worth the extra money to see both views! A must do when visiting NYC.,5.0,4.7496

8017,As advertised,"We decided to go up to the top just after sunset to get some night views of the city. It was crowded but the lines we no where near as long as they could have been. We didn't have to wait at all to get to the first stop where the inside viewing area is. Then there was a bit of a line to go the extra few floors to the outside viewing area.

Great views of the city. Its not very wide up there and people are like 2 deep trying to get a look. If you are patient you will get the views you want. I can't imagine when the line is longer.

They also accept Citipass as the entrance ticket so you don't need to wait in line to exchange ticket or anything.

Stay away from the jerks walking around outside that try to sell you tickets. I don't know if work for the Empire State Building as they say they do but they are rude and pushy.",4.0,3.1288

8020,Bad experience;,"I'm from Mexico and I decided this place to celebrate my birthday with my family, but we had a really bad experience overall.
First we was there just a short time and we get lost finding was the correct door, we were asking the guards at the doors and they was really rude, some of them didn't even answer to us.
Finally we get inside the building and they was good but nobody told us that because of the weather we won't see anything, I understand that is not your fault or something that you can control (talking about the weather), but when you are a turist not always know about this kind of situasions.
So, just an awere or a comment about it could be a good thing.
It was one of my dream places, I was so exated, but when I saw my family been treated like racist way or maybe just unkind and then just see the clouds at the top I ending up so disappointed that I can't recommend this place to any of my friends or go again.",2.0,1.3556

One word of warning - seems like everyone had the same idea as me - it was very crowded. Unforgettable though.",5.0,4.4932

We went on Monday afternoon around 5pm and it wasn't too busy. Would I pay for the VIP again - no, it really didn't warrant that. The landmark was nice, it was nice going up in the elevator to it and the views from the top amazing. I wouldn't go again as it wasn't the best high building statue/attraction I have been on, I have been on better. It wasn't as clean and immaculate as others, it was just nothing special which was disappointing. There is a shop, this was probably the longest queue!

But we had to use our tickets already bought before our trip ended. So we went up the building the second time we tried. Well, the sun peeked out a little we were able to see Manhattan quite well. Our recommendation is NOT to buy tickets prematurely (like, online before our trip); buy it onsite. Employees were quite helpful to give advise at the ground level.",4.0,4.7428

Pros
1. Great views from the top.
2. Lift is fun too (Lift roof is a screen that runs visuals like GoT)
3. No queues in the morning. And with NYC pass you can just scan your pass at gate. no ticket required.
4. On a clear day you can see very far

Cons
1. Views are from behind fence.

Tip
Get a jacket as on a summer day it gets cold up there.",4.0,4.744
8049,Breathtaking,The Empire State Building needs no introduction. The view from the 86th floor is amazing. You can see the entire city from there. We could see the sun setting.

At this stage you have no printer with you (obviously).

8052,Girlfriend trip to NYC,"We went to The Empire State Building around 11:00 a.m. on a Monday morning. We were expecting the crowds to be horrendous. Since we were expecting crowds, we planned to buy tickets and schedule to go the next day. When we got there, we walked directly to the ticket counter, from there directly to the elevator, with approximately 20 people in front of us. Once we got to the top, there were people there, but there were no crowds. When we talked to other people later on our trip, they said they were very surprised because that was extremely uncommon. This happened to us twice on our trip. At the Empire State Building and at Rockefeller Center. It must have just been the perfect week to go.",5.0,4.2348

Earlier that day we visited Top of the Rock in Rockefeller Center in large part so that we could have a view of the skyline with the Empire State Building in it. It was nice to visit two great overlooks and see the city during the day and at night.

The only downside to visiting the Empire State Building was interacting with some of the employees; particularly in the security area. One worker was yelling directions at a visitor who clearly couldn’t speak English and was having a hard time. Other than that we had a great time and would recommend it to anyone.",5.0,4.921

We had beautiful weather. I had read that the lines start getting long around mid-morning. So, with that in mind I had my crew there when they opened for tours. We had no issues what so ever. We breezed through all the way to the observation deck. I will say, by the time we left there were lines starting to form.

It’s cool to say you went to the top of the Empire State Building but I wonder if other buildings have cheaper prices, and if so that might be the better deal in my opinion.",4.0,4.5186

8079,"0% visibility, 100% magic","After meticulous planning of our trip to New York, visiting the Empire State Building was always going to happen on 20th June - my wife's birthday. Trouble was, the weather than day wasn't great and there was zero visibility. We were told about this by the staff at the bottom of the building and informed that we could use our ticket on another day because it was valid for a year. We chose to go up anyway because this was a once in a lifetime trip, it was my wife's birthday and the rest of our trip was full of other sightseeing. It turned out to be a magical experience.

Reaching the top was easy. Very few other people were there and we were on our own in the lifts up to the top. Don't forget to look up during the first lift journey to watch the building being erected around you. First stop is the 79th floor for a little exhibition. Second stop is the main observation deck on the 86th floor (Note: the very top deck on the 102nd floor is current closed for refurbishment).

Visibility on the main observation deck was exactly how they said it would be at the bottom - zero. Determined to enjoy ourselves we got talking to one of the security guards called Julius. These guys deserve serious credit - come rain or shine, heatwave or plunging temperatures, these guys are outside braving the elements - and Julius was a superstar! He made us feel so welcome and helped to point out where buildings would have been had we been able to see anything!

After a while we were joined by a family with tow young girls. Julius spoke to them as well and told the girls that it they blew hard enough, maybe the clouds will part so they can see something. Sure enough, they blew - and the clouds parted long enough for us to see the tops of a couple of buildings! The timing was immaculate and those two girls will have some great memories (as do we!).

So, thanks to Julius we loved our time at the Empire State Building and would highly recommend it. Don't necessarily be put off if visibility is poor - you might not be able to see everything, but having the building to yourself and catching a glimpse as clouds move around is just as magical.",5.0,4.8316

The day was a glorious spring day and I couldn't wipe the grin from my face as I entered this building. As a visitor from Australia, much of our pop culture comes from the USA and let's face it, the Empire State Building features in a lot of movies and TV. I felt like a giggly school kid as I lived one of my NYC dreams by going up to the observatory and viewing Manhattan below.

The family picture was taken so quickly that the picture didn't come out right. so we asked for a retake and we got the family picture retaken. When it was time to get our pictures when we descended from the top floor, we waited about 30 minutes for our picture to be developed and since they kept on giving us excuses of why they were taking so long, we decided to come back during the evening attraction. We we came back, my family and I took the evening picture for memory sake, and when we went to the picture area, they made us wait an additional 20 minutes just to tell us they lost the footage we took in the morning. They didnt even give us a discount on the evening picture. But either than the photography department, everything was wonderful and and the view was beautiful.",4.0,4.8708
8118,Family trip,We visited the empire state building during the day. It wasn't that busy but would have liked to have gone at night.

8120,Really (REALLY) Busy - holiday season...,"If you're visiting the Empire State Building (or any other major landmark) on a holiday / peak time - here are a couple of things to consider. 1) Check the wait times BEFORE you buy tickets, as you may be stuck in an impossible line, waiting for hours, with little chance of a ticket refund. 2) Check the refund policy before you buy the tickets (see above!), 3) Note that the Empire State Building entrance line and ticket line are the SAME, until the very last moment when you pass the ticket kiosks.

Therefore - you truly do NOT skip the ticket line, as everyone is in the same line, and the ticket purchase process is more or less instant, no matter if you buy them - ahead of time (online), or at the self-service kiosk (once you're finally inside the building). We purchased our tickets through Musement.com, and admit that it was a peak (Christmas / New Years) week to visit.

The purchase itself was easy, though when we arrived there and realized how long the wait was (more than 2 hours) - we could not reach anyone on the customer service phone line, and likely would not have received a refund anyway. Live and learn!",3.0,4.6284

8137,Empire State Building,"We went on a Sunday evening right before sunset. We bought our tickets at the ESB. The wait wasn't bad-maybe 30 minutes. When we arrived at the top, there were so many people that we were crushed front to back. There was little room for movement. The ESB employee was trying to get people to move away from the edge so others could see. The people would not move. He raised his voice and shouted, ""The sun is gone,"" hoping they would move on. They did not. People were even crammed on the ramps leading to the viewing area. Another employee was being very firm trying to get people to move. While I wormed my way under arms to the edge to get a look, my husband could not. He was never able to see the skyline. It was extremely frustrating and disappointing. They allowed way too many people up there at one time and could not control the crowd. Next time, it's Top of the Rock for me!",3.0,1.6918

8145,Oh that night sky,"We’d had a meal out, and on a whim decided to see whether we could go up the Empire State Building then and there. Partly I suppose because the following day was forecast to be wet, and it was to be our last day in NYC, and we didn’t want to miss the opportunity of a clear view. So off we went, and found it was still open, so up we went.
I confess I am not great with heights, and I opted not to look up at the ceiling video as we went up, but overall I had no problem with the height. There was a bit of a queue for the second lift up, but mostly it kept moving.
Before we went up I wasn’t sure I’d want to go out on the outdoor gallery, but the sight of the city lights below was so stunning I just went out there. It feels completely secure, so I had no worries. It was pretty chilly on one side though, but hardly surprising being so high up.
The views are simply incredible and I am so glad we acted on our whim!
Could we have prebooked and paid less? Probably. But so glad we went when we did.",5.0,4.9174

8149,Loved it!,"This is probably my favorite building to visit so I don’t know if my opinion is objective! I really like Empire State Building!
For me everything was perfect during our visit. At ground level there is model of Empire State Building which is perfect for taking pictures. Then the elevator takes too floor where all details about construction of building are shown like time schedules from time of construction and similar things.
After this you will go up to observatory level which is opened (not closed in glass but open!) which is my favorite part. You can actually see, hear and smell (which is not always nice 😂) New York!
I would only recommend to visit this piece of history on a sunny or at least not a rainy day because view is impressive on all for sides",5.0,4.9464

The cost was not prohibitive and after collecting our tickets we were again guided by extremely well informed and friendly staff to join the queue to enter the lifts.

I discovered that you could purchase a ticket to ""skip to the front"" for $40 more. Awesome! Lesson learned!! Well worth the price not to stand in line for two hours. So, I buy my tickets online for a 9:00 entry on a Sunday for my second visit. No advice or warnings on the website. Like, hey first thing in the morning you don't need to spend the extra money because THERE IS NO ONE THERE usually.

It’s basically a view from a very tall building and that’s it. Very quick ride up the elevator to the observatory deck. Spend 20–30 minutes up there looking at some of the old photographs and reading some of the history and then walking around the observatory deck. Then back down the elevator. There is not much more than that. Quite expensive for what it is.",3.0,1.5806

8204,empire state building,Classic must see visit. The workers are knowledgeable and the building itself provides such a classic view of the city. The workers also help guy even if weather is bad and you go at 1 in the morning,5.0,2.5954
8205,A fantastic experience,We visited the Empire State Building after last being there 8 years ago. We had two young children with us. From the moment we arrived until we left it was a really great experience. The queue moved quickly. The staff were helpful and professional. It was as entertaining for our six year old as it was for us.,5.0,4.7554
8206,Great views at night,"We done this in the evening as wished to see something different. We were not dissapointed, the views are fantasic, very friendly staff and not to be missed. We had already done top of the rock during the day but was amazing to see the difference of the skyline at night. Well worth doing.",5.0,4.846
8207,Must see,We went on a Friday afternoon and the wait was only minutes. The view is unbelievable and we were lucky to have a clear day and views for miles .,5.0,4.4702
8208,"Amazing, short queues","I went past 8pm and asked one of the staff on ground level what the queue time was; he said 10 mins - good estimate. There is a ticket queue but you should save some money by looking for queue tickets online with small discounts. There is also a short queue to get through security and later a short elevator queue. Just queue a little and get through, it’s no big deal and it would not be worth buying the skip the line queue ticket for the elevator and security queues.

For the elevator queue, there are ample elevators and traffic is controlled very effectively by staff. They go up and down nonstop. All staff are also very friendly.

The view of course is absolutely beautiful. The ESB is taller than the Eiffel Tower.",5.0,4.9526
8209,Empire State Building,Gorgeous building - art deco and tallllllll. Not one for those with height issues but you can't not visit it. Might be best taking your pictures streets away so you can capture the building at it fullest,4.0,4.7038

8212,A Beauty from A Distance,"I may have a biased opinion on this because I never actually went inside the Empire State Building, but I don’t believe it’s worth it to go to the top of the building. Another more affordable option would be to go to the Top of the Rock or see the skyline from the High Line. You could get a good picture with/of the Empire State Building when you’re closer to Madison Square Garden.",4.0,4.6844
8213,Fun,very good views from high up. Could see many land marks. lots of fun. Wish they had an audio tour to point out land marks.,5.0,4.6958

It was breathtaking and highly recommended to take this tour.,4.0,4.8804
8215,A must for 1st time in New York!,This was my 1st visit to New York and the views were amazing from the top. Gift shop was good too to get gifts for back home. Well worth the money as how can you go to NY and not go up the iconic building.,5.0,4.8492

Loved the video at the roof of the elevator as we ascended. The views were amazing and we loved it.",5.0,4.9172

8225,Our impressions,"We expected to have an audio tour available for the 86th floor; but there was none. Unfortunately,

8228,More communication,"The overall experience was awesome! I purchased the Express tickets for my husband and I and as expected we didn't have wait on lines going up or coming back down. This is great if you have the extra funds because the lines are long. Only one minor complaint, when we entered no one communicated that there was an express elevator and we had to continuously ask staff about the express lane, even though we were following the red carpet. The staff assumed that you don't have express tickets and herds everyone to the lines which can be a bit frustrating. Staff maybe needs a bit of retraining or a customer service refresher so the consumer does not have to figure it out on their own.",4.0,3.9852
8229,Iconic View,"This was one of the great views of nYc. I’m soo glad I was able to come to see what everyone was talking about.
The amount of history in this building alone was breath taking. I advise anyone visiting NYC to definitely come to experience the Empire State Building!",5.0,4.6878
8230,Good Time,We enjoyed the views but felt it was too crowded to get some of the pictures we wanted. It would be better if fewer people were allowed on the observation deck at any one time. I did miss the short movie about the building the the Empire State Building which I had see on my first visit 6 years ago.,4.0,4.2498000000000005
8231,Empire State experience,"Best to order tickets online and go mid-morning. We went mid-morning on a Saturday and there was no wait so the premium you would pay for a fast lane ticket isn't necessary. Note that the entrance is not on 5th but on West 34th which is the cross-street to the north. Staff was extremely knowledgeable and friendly, the floors, walls, elevators etc in pristine condition, and there is a lot to learn and see - the views are amazing. Great gift shop.",5.0,4.9452

8233,Empire - At your feet!,"What an amazing view and superb treatment at the Empire State Building. Truly treated like states men.
Our whole visit was fantastic and worth every penny.
We visited early Saturday morning. It appeared slightly overcast but it soon cleared. We queued from about 7.45 in the morning, not much of a queue. Straight to the top at 8 had a fab wander around on the 86th floor with clear open views all around. Brilliant.
The staff were very helpful and knowledgable, courteous and polite.
Amazing visit. We'll be doing it again the next time we are in NY.",5.0,4.9834
8234,Great Views,"A very popular observation level. It is however on the expensive side. Just go to the 86th floor, the view is great from there. No real need to go to the 102 floor. Much better to take photos from here rather than the One World Observatory and there is no reflection from surrounding glass like the One World Observatory.",5.0,4.6958

8237,Spectacular Night Lights,I love that this attraction is open until 2 a.m. We ventured up around 11 p.m. and were pleasantly surprised but the tolerable lines. As expected the view was amazing and to see it at night only made the experience better. The outside viewing area isn't very wide so it is difficult to navigate with the crowds.

The crowds were huge at that time of day, and we ended up taking the stairs for the last 6 floors, or else we would have missed the sunset. We also walked down the stairs, to avoid the long line up for the elevators.
The view was amazing, glad we went up, but would not do it at sunset again as the observation deck was shoulder to shoulder, jammed with people.",4.0,4.8588000000000005

8244,"EXPENSIVE, MUST SEE EXPERIENCE","We have been to New York a couple times both in the summer and Christmas time, and both times have went up the Empire State Building. Being up both at day and night time both experiences were worth the money, At night you get to see all the bright lights of NYC, while the day you get the ocean and the beautiful scenery of the city.

The awesome views, old elevator rides, bright lights, and the history of the building make this incredible building worth the trip.

only cons were the line up and the cost.",4.0,4.897

8246,Empire State Building - Expedited Line,"The attraction was great, however, not sure it was worth paying for the expedited ticket as the line was not that long. We visited at approximately 4:30 PM on a Tuesday in early June. Also, the line to get out was not expedited, so even though we were expedited up to the upper floor we had to wait in line to get out of the building. Why isn't that expedited as well?

Arrived about 10.30am,on a normal week day, greeted with a small line of people, no real delays or hassles.

Amazing to think that while the erection of this American icon was in the early stages of being built (Started 23rd.Sept 1929) - (Completed 1st.May 1931). Bonnie & Clyde started their life of crime 3 years later.

8251,A must for all first-time visitors to New York,"We took our 15-year-old daughter to see New York for the first time, and of course the Empire State Building was on the list. My husband and I both visited the site decades ago, and despite the security checks that are now in place, everything went very smoothly and efficiently. We booked online before going - I would definitely advise anyone to do that - and were at the top in under 20 minutes. We had a ticket that allowed us to visit during the day and after nine PM at the same day, which was great, seeing NY by day as well as by night. Both times we got a beautiful view of New York, lots of opportunity to take pictures and selfies. Great experience!",5.0,4.942
8252,VIP tickets are totally worthy,"Been there twice. Once without kids. Once with kids. The first visit without kids, we visited the Empire State at 11pm which was excellent. There was no queue at all. And you get the whole deck almost to yourself!

The second time we travelled with young children so we got there around 8pm. We purchased the VIP tickets though which is highly recommended if you are traveling with young children. The queue was super long and I can assure you the VIP tickets are extremely worthy. You are literally treated like a VIP. Best part is they are free for kids under 6. So if you’re travelling with children do consider getting the VIP tickets. Even the security line was short for us. It took us probably 10 mins from buying the tickets to the observation deck.

The deck was packed with people at 8pm though. We went during summer so 8pm is just around sunset. You can hardly move and walk around out there. Ended up staying inside most of the time.

The view was excellent. The best I have seen so far. Mainly due to the density of NYC the lights were amazing at night. No other views can beat this. Highly recommended.",4.0,4.99

8255,"Very, Very Cool","I was wary of visiting the Empire State Building, as I've heard horror stories of long lines and huge crowds and the experience not living up to the hype. To combat at least a couple of these issues, we arrived within 15 minutes of it opening in the morning and essentially had no wait. It made for a surprisingly quick and pleasant experience. I really enjoyed the exhibit you walk through before going up to the observation deck. The observation deck is pretty small, but there are great views from all directions. It was a bit hazy when we visited, so lower Manhattan was just barely visible, but you could still make out the buildings. We visited on the first morning of our trip, so it was a great way to get our bearings of what was where. Even though we started out with no crowd, the observation deck began to fill up VERY quickly. I can see where arriving in the late morning/afternoon during peak crowd times could make for a nightmarish experience. Overall, our visit lived up to the hype and, while ""touristy,"" was absolutely worth it.",4.0,4.825

8261,Poor,"Although the view from the top is amazing it’s very uncomfortable with poor crowd control at the top, constant pushing and shoving. Worst thing is that it has grills around the top so you can’t really take decent pictures without risking dropping your phone, picture attached will demonstrate. We purchased the standard ticket and even then thought it was too much!",1.0,2.2832
8262,Amazing experience but ...BEWARE the official photographs. Check the quality carefully before parting with your cash.,"We visited the Empire State Building and the Rockefeller Centre Top of the Rock on the same day. It was a lovely sunny day with a clear blue sky. Ideal for seeing the views of NYC from these iconic buildings. If you only have time for one of these attractions I would say the the Rockefeller Centre has a slight edge because of its views of Central Park (and the Empire State Building) from the top. The only disappointment, and the reason I have dropped two stars from this review, was the official photograph. We might not get another chance to visit the USA so we went for the full tourist package and bought the photograph package of us superimposed on the skyline of NYC. I made the mistake of not checking the hard copies before leaving the building. Unlike any of the other superimposed images we’ve bought (including Top of the Rock) the ones from the Empire State Building has the background showing through our images. We look like ghosts. Despite sending 4 emails asking if this could be corrected or our money refunded, we only received two responses and neither of these addressed the main issue of the failed superimposition. The last email I received was to remind me that my membership was about to expire. Without more information I assume that the digital copies are deleted when the membership expires and there is no chance now of having a decent souvenir of our visit. The memories of our time in this unique city have been marred slightly by the feeling that we have been duped.",3.0,4.494

8265,Always a breathtaking view,"We purchased the City Pass and one of the venues is the Empire State Building. That ticket allows you to go up during the day and then to return later in the evening using the same ticket. The evening visit requires you to go after 10:00p.m., but the night view is well worth seeing. The elevators take you up to the 80th floor. At that point you have the choice of taking the second elevator up to the 86th floor or walking up 6 flights of stairs. Since the wait can we long, employees will encourage you to take the stairs for the remaining 6 floors. We did walk up during the day when the lines were long, but waited for the elevator in the evening. The line was much shorter. You can pay an extra fee to go to the 102 floor, but we felt the view was plenty fine on the 86th floor. Panoramic view. Great experience.",5.0,4.8986

We also went up quite a few floors to the ticket reception, and seen quite a bit of pictures and memorabilia. Guess who's in quite a bit of this memorabilia? King Kong, of course!

We went to the very top, there was a crowd of people but it was orderly and very tolerable. Everyone taking pictures and asking others to take pictures for them.
The view of the city is breathtaking and you can walk around the entire parameter of the building a view all 4 sides.
Upon entering the building you will want to take your photos because you don't pass the same way out. You will be asked to pose for a professional shot like they do at amusement parks and at the end of your visit you will be asked if you are interested in purchasing them. Of course you will also walk thorough a very large gift shop before you truly exit the top floors. These are trinkets and books and such that you wont find outside of the attraction.

8290,Just like in the movies,Very well organized. You get up to the to observation quickly and easily. The lines move. The move is breathtaking. A bit pricey but an experience that should not be missed.,5.0,4.3870000000000005
8291,Needs to improve the service (pictures with the showtime company BAD and dirty bathrooms),"Of course that we are going to expect a good view in one of the highest building of Manhattan. And it is, no doubt about that.
But I gave one sphere because is not only the view, is about the service.
Is like going to a good food restaurant with a terrible service.

1-The personal of the entrance (where you show the ticket), hey guys, find another job, I didn´t have problems with that, but I saw people struggling in the turnstile, because the reader was not working good and the security with a bad attitude, like a government office.

2-The guys that take pictures (what an annoying ""sales"" person), in my second day of course I said - thanks sir I don't want the picture again, and he -OH SORRY YOU HAVE TOO, and I don´t want to waste my time writing what happened next.

3- IMPORTANT: I went in 2 different days and the bathrooms were really dirty.

4- THE WORST don´t buy the digital picture is a really fraud I never see the worst company pictures in a good valuable landmark. Showtime pictures company the worst.
Why the guys that manage the Observatory of the Empire State Building have to work with Showtime pictures ????????",1.0,1.5858
8292,View from th ESB.,The queue to go up both am and pm were very short. The crowd on the viewing platform itself on the pm was larger.

My friends and I went for holiday to New York and decided to do Empire state building tour. What a breathtaking view!
We been told that it usually has a very long waiting time in the que before you get up to the top, but it didn't take us longer than 20-30 mins to get there.
Definitely recommend if you are in NYC!",5.0,4.8738
8296,A Great View!,"Expect to wait a bit, but once you are UP there, it is great. It is a bit crowded at the top, but since there is no one rushing us to leave, it was fine. Take the stairs, if you are able, for at least part of it. Then you will have one less line. A must see for NY.",4.0,4.5752

8307,Immaculate and great views,"Visited as part of our New York pass.
We were impressed with the slick operation of getting us up the tower, the presentation and friendliness of the staff and how immaculate the tower itself is.
2 elevators get you to the top, I believe you can pay extra to go up a further few floors.
The views from the four sides are very good and there are the binoculars as seen on the films that are free to use.
The process of getting back down is a quick as going up although you do have to exit via the gift shop.
We visited approx 3pm in the afternoon and there were no lines or crowds.
We are glad that we visited this iconic piece of New York architecture.",5.0,4.8986
8308,Great Views,"Not much we can say about visiting that hasn’t already been said. Great views all around. Downside to this, and most attractions in New York, is the amount of people visiting the attraction resulting in very big queues and long queuing times. We found that most of the staff were rude or had no idea what was going on. They pretty much pointed you in a direction and said go. We had a pass to get in, purchased online. We showed it to the staff member outside were made to queue by that staff member. We queued for an hour and half only to be told by the staff member at the front of the queue that our pass meant we didn’t need to queue at all. There was also no signage anywhere to tell you of the contrary. Again, amazing views, not so amazing journey to get to them...",5.0,4.8546
8309,OMG!!! Its Ghostbusters!!!,"We visited the ESB as part of another tour and just couldn't believe the volume of visitors lined up outside and round the block. Then once inside if it wasn't for the the skip the line ticket, i don't think we would have made it to the top so please take advantage of any skip the line options.
Once at the museum level, again the crowds were just out of control. Staff opened the stair well to access the 6 levels up to the observation deck. This is where the magic began.
Traveling with our 6 and 8 year old boys, who we had watching different NY based films before we arrived, took one step inside that stairwell and screamed with absolute delight! They were in the GHOSTBUSTERS Stairwell! It was such a magical moment and it was true as well.
Once we arrived at the observation deck we had the most spectacular views of Manhattan it was one of the best experiences of our life!",4.0,4.9008
8310,I have never been a tourist till today,"We are in NYC so often bc we do not live far away. We often drive in for the day with the kids, and at times, my husband and I do some overnight trips when we see a show. Our show finished at 11PM and after an evening cocktail we decided we would walk to the Empire set building and go to the top floor where neither of us had ever been. It was 1AM at this time and it is open until 2. Clearly there was no line, however, there were some people up top. It was totally worth the visit. Not only was there no line and no crowding, the city was beautiful at night. I was very happy with our visit.",5.0,4.737

8317,BEST experience overall just a few issues,"i visted yesterday about 1:00pm lines were moving pretty fast considering how many people was up stairs. the veiw was great. the photo came out pretty good nice quality but when i was going to pay the cashier towards the front was about done ringing up her transaction and was almost done but the person had asked for direction so she had got held up. however there was another cashier with no uniform on so i assumed some type of manger she was on her phone doing my transaction which i thought was pretty disrespectful had short hair and a yellow shirt . since no one was on line i thought i would ask for some direction to get back to where i was staying and she was pretty ruse with her tone. i figured she thought i dint understand english so while i was levaing she said "" how dont she knows where she coming from "" in a angry voice if i knew that people mangers were so rude i wouldnt ask for help again. but overall evryone was really nce to me. i just created an account because someone told me to rate this visit here.",3.0,2.9296

8321,What an amazing view!!,"Wow! This skyscraper is one of my favourites! We visited in the evening so that we can see the city light up! It can get very busy in the evenings, and you might be waiting for around 30minutes to get to the top! The elevator is cool, it has a video playing while you are on your way up.

When we got to the top, it was very busy with people taking many pictures! You have to be polite to ask people to make space for you, in order for you to take good pictures. I got some great shots of times square while lit up. Be careful when taking pictures, because you might need to use your camera/phone through the fence bars to get a clear shot. If you stumble or whatever, you might end up dropping your phone 90 odd floors down!! (Didn't happen to me thankfully). Staff are also very polite and friendly.

Also remember that you need to go through a security screening.",5.0,4.9524

We were blown away by the breathtaking views and how New York looks simply stunning at night. All the lights look incredible.

8337,"If in New York, tick it off your bucket list, just for the view.","Empire State Building was the 1st tourist location we visited after arriving at our hotel in Manhattan.

I pre-booked our tickets on-line so all we had to do was arrive.

By mistake we went to the wrong entrance to the building and came across the worst concierge staff member I have ever come across in all my travels! He was pan faced, blunt and quite rude in his manner in telling us to go around the corner to the correct entrance. (It was something he has to say a thousand times a day and hates it, perhaps he should get a job in a non public facing job) Had I not pre-booked my tickets I would have walked on by.

We arrived at the correct entrance, met by a lovely concierge chap, there was only a short queue to the security process and this was better than any airport screening!

The rest of Empire State Building experience was good a little queueing here and there, we got to the outdoor viewing area and it rained, but this didn’t spoil the experience.

We did a daytime visit.

At a distance the iconic outline is unmistakable. But with the current construction hoardings at sidewalk level we were totally underwhelmed. It is also difficult to photograph at street level.

We went into the building but didn't fork out the $s to travel up the building.

The foyer and free public area satisfied our tourist bucket list. There is a scale model of the building in the atrium that provided a background for been there photographs. The large black and white photos on the wall are worth a passing study.

Finally after to making it to the observation deck it was quite an amazing sight all around. You can see things from the 86th floor however at a slightly higher price you can go up the 102nd but that I believe is from a small enclosed room.

8371,A bit of a disappointment,"Like an old movie star basking on former glories and having been over taken by younger newcomers, this was a disappointing visit to the Empire State Building.

Our first trip for 16 years and first with our three children, we were looking forward to showing them the most famous skyscraper of them all.

We realised before departing for NYC that the 102 floor was not open at this time, though unsure about whether ticket prices had been reduced to reflect that.

What we recalled from previous visits was the 30s grandeur of the entrance and lift lobby so it was a bit disappointing that the current entrance - whilst smart and efficient - is now in a different place. It was overcast early afternoon on Weds 29th May and we'd seemingly timed it well with no queues at the ticket machines. We stood for a second trying to work out what we needed to do with our printed out CityPass C3 vouchers - thinking we needed to exchange this for real tickets - when a rather overzealous employee barked at us ""YOU'RE FINE, GO THAT WAY"" - whilst helpful, it was a bit unnecessarily shouty.

So we went up, looked around, came back down and left. The view was as expected, some of the posters were interesting about the history, but there was nothing particularly engaging, no interaction, certainly nothing to make you feel special - and without the 102 floor element or being able to go near the original lobby - it just felt a bit of a non-event. An expensive non-event.

The challenge the ESB has now is that the One World Observatory is shiny, modern and high-tech and the Rockefeller Center has the benefit of being able to see the ESB in front of it, so has better visuals.

The problem we had as visitors to NYC is that you still feel like you 'have' to go up the Empire State Building, and it feels like they know that and are still milking it without putting much effort in.",2.0,4.9458

At the glass observation deck it was a little crowded, I'd hate to see it on a busy time.

8408,Good views but long queues,"Used a City Pass to go up Empire State. Queues were all the way up the street and around the corner and then had to queue inside too, in total approx 1hr.
Views were good but due to the sides of the building, viewing was limited and the viewing areas seemed quite squashed and overcrowded. Due to the length of queues to get up in the lift, we chose to take the stairs. There were lots of alterations being done inside the building too.
Overall a good sight to see, however we queued for longer than we were actually at the top seeing the views. We had gone to Rockefeller a few days before, which was a much better experience.",4.0,4.7181999999999995

First you are send to the back entrance to buy a ticket than you go thru security have to wait for the elevator to go to the 79th floor to change and wait for the second elevator to go the 86th floor. By this time there was no sun and the observation deck was in a fog and you could barely see the streets below. For this view I had to pay $120.00 for a party of three.

I found Top of the Rock to be a better experience and view. Only did that one at night. The line for this one during the day was nearly unbearable. Hours long and definitely not worth the wait. Actually there are multiple lines. One outside the building. One inside. Another one inside to get to security. Then another one to get to the elevators. And another to actually get to the top on another elevator (unless they let you climb stairs for 5 minutes...man that works the calfs!)",3.0,4.7186

8480,The untouchable icon of NY!,"To me the Empire State Building is simply the greatest building on earth. It's the untouchable icon of New York.
It was an amazing and unforgettable experience, you also feel a lot of american history in your own way.

8486,Great tour,"This was by far the best tour in NYC and the reason is because of a special lady that works there named RENITA.
The day we arrived at the building it was 100% raining and cloud cover was low. RENITA greeted us and told us to come back on another day because we would see nothing but clouds. Renita proceeded to talk to us for a few minutes and we left a little disappointed to not be able to tour but thankful she cared enough to not let us waste our time or money. We were very lucky to have run into her. We returned a few days later and saw RENITA again and she smiled and waved and she brighten our day even more. The ride to the top is fast and you don’t even know you are in an elevator it is so smooth and a movie shows on the ceiling. When the doors open you can’t catch your breath the view is so amazing. We were just in awe. All of a sudden RENITA shows up and takes our pictures at the top, hugs us and tells us have a great rest of our trip. This is an amazing lady and your company is so lucky to have her employed there.
This is a must do tour in NYC!!",5.0,4.9922

8498,Empire State Building - Massively overated,"Our family visited on a Friday morning in May. We bought standard tickets. There was a long queue on the street which cleared quickly, but led to a much longer queue inside the building. We were in the queue for well over an hour with no guidance on how long our wait would be. The observation deck is small and was very overcrowded. All of this compared very unfavorably with the Rockefeller Tower and Statue of Liberty which we visited in the same week.",1.0,4.3716

8502,Iconic Art Deco Building that is a must see,"The Empire State Building is an attraction that you simply must visit. Everyone worldwide knows it from films (King Kong) and TV shows. It was, and still is, instantly recognisable and nothing else says New York like the Empire State Building. Take the high speed elevators to the 2 viewing platforms for fantastic views all around New York and beyond. The views down towards the street with the traffic looking like little toys is breathtaking. A must see attraction.",5.0,4.8926
8503,King Kong was not in residence!,"Of course, one has to come here. This is an iconic site, one of the most associated with New York City. Fortunately, our hotel was a couple of blocks away, just a short walk. We chose to go at night mainly because we had visited other attractions all that day. But a night visit is quite nice because the city at night seems better than the city during the day. But I digress.

Tickets got us up to the upper observing deck and even at night it seemed you could see forever. Quite windy and chilly on this visit and a light jacket was well appreciated. There are those pay binoculars to use - in my case I simply used the zoom of my camera. Overall, a nice visit, even if King Kong was not hanging out! :-)",4.0,4.9158
8504,Great views!,"A friend got me a voucher for this. I went one evening just before sunset but staff were kind enough to tell me that the view was pretty bad so I went again the next day when the view was much better! I liked the models of the building and some of the additional information available on the way up. I work in Procurement so the quantities of materials and costs were really interesting and that it only took just over a year to build is amazing!

The view was really good though predictably packed full of people trying to get around so difficult to always see or take pictures. It was good to see pictures of the celebs who had been there too.

Only downfall was some of the service and staff. The queueing system was really badly managed. I asked if I could take the stairs down instead of waiting for the lift (I was allowed to come up this way) and the lady told me to wait. I waited and then when large crowds of people went down that way I just followed them. Needs to be managed better.",4.0,4.9638
8505,Always a classic New York experience,I've been going up to Observation Deck since I was a kid and it never gets old. The opportunity to get outside in the open air is not like anything else. You can take your time with the kids and learn all about the construction of the building and the city or you can cap off a date night after a show. Bonus if you go home and watch the original King Kong.,5.0,4.5144
8506,Very expensive!,"The most expensive visit we did ever - 36 USD paying just for the elevator to take you up to 89th floor. Otherwise, very well organized and swift. Staff here was even polite and accommodating unlike with other instiutions/museums.",5.0,3.9854000000000003
8507,Dream Trip,We timed our trip to view the top at dusk. There was very little wait time for the elevator ride up. The lines moved quickly and lots of staff were there to guide us. We had time to walk around once then the lights of the buildings began coming on and it was a spectacuular view.,5.0,3.4046

8510,A visit to the Empire State Building,I went to visit the famous Empire State building past year. It was a very nice experience. Finding tickets was very easy and ecoomic but I suggest to buy the priority ticket to avoid the long cues. In a few seconds you are transported with a very fast lift to the last floor of the building and you can enjoy one of the most amazing views of New York City. Highly recommended.,5.0,4.8629999999999995
8511,Stunning views,"I have no head for heights but felt I had to see this. It was a very clear, sunny day but freezing cold with a strong wind blowing. There was no queue and I was able to get straight up the building to the observation deck with no waiting. The lift ceiling video display is an absolute hoot! The views were truly stupendous in the cold crisp air and there wasn't a lot of people, allowing me to take my time (with frequent dashes inside to thaw out my fingers) and really take it all in. I was so absorbed in enjoying the view that I forgot to be scared of the height! An unforgettable experience.",4.0,4.8772
8512,Hope you brought your camera because the views are worth the long waits,"Something that's so iconic to New York is The Empire State Building. And if you have watched the movie Sleepless in Seattle, you will want to see the iconic stop where they meet up.The views are absolutely worth the long lines but if you want to skip them then check to see the quiet times.

8514,New York Pass,"We ended up going to the Empire State Building later in the evening than what had planned. We arrived at the building at about 1100 PM. It was still crowded with people entering and leaving. I was surprised at how busy it was. The trip to 86th Floor was fast but we were quickly moved into a line to wait for the elevator to take us to the observation deck. It was a 45 minute wait which I was not prepared for. The elevator operator said there was wait to climb the 6 flights of stairs to avoid the line long wait so we went for it. 3 flights up we hit a line and it was also slow going. Very hot inside the stair well, no fresh air. Once we made it to the observation deck it was packed with people trying to get the best skyline pictures. Everyone was nice but it was tough to move around without bumping into someone. The view was worth it.",4.0,4.7796

8526,Lots of skyline to see,I used a City Explorer voucher so I felt I was getting a good deal. We went on a fairly quite day - no queues but when I got to the top it was massively crowded and there isnt a lot of space to move around. You have to jostle for a viewing spot. They take our picture on entry and super impose the New York skyline (at night). The pic is $26 which I brought. If you do it make sure you strike the right pose. All in all I think we only spent 20 mins at the top - there are only so many angles and landmarks you can identify and the crowds are off-putting. I wouldn't go up again.,3.0,4.7082
8527,Go early when its less busy,"go early you will get better views and miss the queues, well worth a visit stunning scenery. we used our explorer pass to get in",5.0,4.569
8528,The Best View in Town,"We went with the expectation of queuing as we decided not to get the fast pass. Our tickets were $32 as opposed to the fast pass($65). We were pleasantly surprised a quick walk to the lifts...no queuing and up to the 89th floor in 43seconds. Then on to the next lift and again straight up.
Please dont waste your money on the fast pass this is really not necessary. Also you dont need to book a time (unlike the Rockafelller). The doorman was lovely and in the lift when you look up they play a film giving the impression that the building is being built...fantastic!",5.0,4.9206

8531,Night time NYC views :),I wanted to see NYC at night so I went up the observatory at night and it was a clear day so saw all of Manhattan from the 4 views in the observatory. It was $43 dollars and we didn't pre book but there was no great line so we didn't have to wait long.

If you want to identify the less obvious buildings they offerr use of an tablet for an additional charge. Queuing was needed for the lift to the outside part of the building. This is the iconic part and well worth it. Overall a great place to viisit.,4.0,4.8764
8537,Very Crowded,"Went during the day and it was a 1.5 hour wait to get through security. Went back at dusk and much smaller wait time. You have to wait to get tickets, go through security, wait for a picture shot, wait for elevators going up and down and wait to go on the observation deck. When you get to the observation deck, the crowd is 4-5 people deep. It is a great view, but it takes a couple of hours or more to see it.",3.0,4.2118

8559,Well executed experience,"When you first walk in it might be a bit daunting to find your way around, but the staff are very polite, helpful, hospitable, and knowledgeable when it comes to directing you to where you need to go for which type of ticket/registration, etc. There aren't many accessible bathrooms at every stage of the tour, and I imagine you'd be in more discomfort if you had a longer wait for the elevator than we did. The views are amazing! It's a tight squeeze for tourism, but it seemed that everybody understood we were all in the same boat just trying to get the most our of our experiences.",4.0,4.5116
8560,ESB VIP Express Pass is worth every penny,"Worth every penny if you are hard pressed for time. we had only 12 hours in NYC to cover Lady luberty, ESB, Time Square, Broadway. we took the ESB VIP pass (double the regular price!). It tool us under an hour from start to finish of the view in ESB. I would recommend this if you need to be treated special or you are absolutely hard pressed for time. Out case was both and it was an absolute winner with my family visiting from overseas",5.0,4.85
8561,An amazing view of NYC,"The view from the ESB is stunning. The day we visited it was SO windy, but the skies were clear and you could see for miles.

8563,Fantastic Views,"We had heard that the queues could be very lengthy to visit the Empire State Building so my wife and I arrived at 8.00a.m. when it opens and walked straight in.
We also chose to go when we knew the weather would be good and the view would be clear. We weren’t disappointed. The view was breathtaking.
There are also fixed binoculars on stands on every side at the top which are free to use. My wife also bought several presents at the gift shop on the ground floor which along with the photograph we bought of us with a background image of the building are lovely memories of a wonderful experience. Would definitely recommend.",5.0,4.9552

8566,A must see,The most iconic building in New York we have all see it in many movies. When you get to the top the views are amazing looking all over Manhattan. It was well organised and professional done. I had visited another building the night before and was run a bit chaotic. They also stay only till 2am so there is plenty of opportunity to visit and I highly recommend it,4.0,4.6878
8567,Empire-tall building.,"I've been to the top of this building in 1987. Now it is extremely expensive. We went inside and asked how far we could go up for free in 2017. One usher said it was a capitolistic building so it would cost something. I did not appreciate the sarcasm. People like that shouldn't work with the public.

Anyway, it's always fun to look at the building anywhere you are in Manhattan, etc. The Lobby is marbley. There are always lots of people going in and out of the building. The wait to go to the top is usually lengthy. There are discounts if you know where to look in NY, etc.",1.0,4.7618

Stunning views from the 86th floor, with some great exhibits and information about the construction.",5.0,4.7707999999999995
8569,It was okay,"Glad I did it once, but will not go back. At least on the night that I was there, I felt it was crowded and rushed. Employees did their jobs, but none were particularly helpful or friendly. The building itself seemed to have a lot of construction going on, so not as glamorous on the inside as I thought it would be. Additionally, at the end of the experience, they funnel you into one of the biggest, over-priced gift shops that I had seen.",3.0,4.061
8570,Fun,"Staff friendly and entertaining, things to see while waiting in the queue. Just a must see. Floor 102 under renovation which we only found out about at top. Earlier better time to pop up as less crowded.",5.0,4.7378

8572,Empire State of mind,"What an amazing city, first time in NY. Great views from the most famous building in the US. Spectacular views of NYC and a great start to my wife’s 40th. Definitely worth a visit when in NY. You can pay in entrance or use one of the various city attraction passes. Great photos of the city day or night",5.0,4.9458

8574,A must visit in NYC,"You just can’t go to NYC and not visit Empire State Building. Fabulous views and photo opportunities. The queues can be long but we walked straight up on a Tuesday afternoon.

Definitely recomment",5.0,4.672
8575,Good Timing,We went early and that meant that from the entrance to the top took about 20 mins (unlike some friends who stood in lines for 4 hours). It is worth getting to the top - and it was a relatively clear day - to see the city and the river: it puts things into perspective.,5.0,4.6962

8577,The most iconic landmark in NYC,"It's the Empire State Building. One of the most iconic landmarks in New York City and definitely worth a trip if you are visiting, if you live here and have F&F in town, or just because you live here and want to see what all he fuss is about. The building is tall and the elevators are fast. The tickets aren't cheap and the lines can be long but you can pay to skip the line or you can go early in the morning to avoid the huge crowds. If you go early, take a jacket or sweater as it gets colds very high up in the clouds!",5.0,3.6328
8578,Don’t waste your time and money!,"It is too overpriced! You can experience the view with a drink/food from a different location!!!

8579,“Amazing building “,"I was asked recently the highlight of our month long trip and after thinking of the many fantastic things we saw and did, I said the Empire State was it . This is an incredible building and considering it was built around 1930 is amazing . The other thing that stands out is that it was built in about 12 months.
An absolute must when you visit New York.

8580,Breathtaking!,"We visited the top of the Empire State Building around 12:30am. It was absolutely breathtaking. Would 100% recommend a visit. It’s so worth the ticket price. When we got to the top we were greeted by such friendly staff that pointed out different city landmarks to us. If you’re lucky enough to be there when Melvin and Freddy are working, you’re in for a treat. They were so kind and helpful. They really made our trip an experience we’ll never forget!",5.0,4.9638
8581,An iconic building... But it's chaos!,"Visited with two under 10's and obviously wanted to see such an iconic NYC landmark. The trouble is, it's so busy and so many people are crammed in it's hard to actually see anything! I visited 13 years ago and remember clearly walking in the main concourse which was plush and opulent... These days you are herded through a different entrance which does not give you any sense of the building.

The queuing (and I use that term loosely) outside is chaotic and it wasn't clear where we needed to go and once inside you were funneled through a relentless series of lanes and checks until you finally get to a lift to go up to the observatory.

Once up on the deck you have some excellent views... If you can get to the front of the exceedingly narrow gangway that is so full you have to hope that you have come to a halt behind someone who is about to move in. This made it difficult to enjoy with young children as most of the time they could not see anything!

In short it is a 'must do' because it's so iconic... But the experience and set up at TOTR is much more family friendly",3.0,4.621
8582,Iconic,"On my first visit to NYC I had to go to the Empire State Building. Fortunately we arrived at the building in the early afternoon and there was no line for tickets and just a few minute wait for the elevators. We lucked out.

The view is amazing! You can see the entire island of Manhatten plus Brooklyn and over to New Jersey. We worth the cost.",5.0,4.5424
8583,Great organization and friendly stuff,"Must see in NY. Great organization, very nice staff, nice gift shop, very beautifull view. You can go outsided or stay in and have a great view.",5.0,4.9074
8584,Not the Same Experience Anymore,"The top of the Empire State Building used to be one of the first places I would take anyone visiting NYC for the first time, not just for the views but for the entire experience. The history panels are gone, the displays as you make your way up to the top are gone, and the ride in the old elevator with the fun guide/operator that interacted with you and told you stories about the building are gone. I understand the millions of people passing through the site takes a toll over time but the streamlined process to get us in and out has removed the very reason to go into the building in the first place. It should still be about the history and people who risked their lives to build such an impressive structure. Not about a ten-minute photo op and ride back to the gift shop. The view of the city is still fabulous but the experience isn't.",2.0,4.9236
8585,Amazing views,"We were able to get there on a day that was not to busy. I don’t think I would have waited in line for hours to see it. The history and photos of the building are great. They give a lot of detail that I was unaware of. The views are spectacular, the day we went there was some haze but you could still see the Statue of Liberty, the park and all other sights. The elevator ride is not bad. They play a video on the ceiling as you go up that is like you were there when it was being built. It keeps your mind off the approximate one minute ride up. Enjoy and don’t forget your cameras!",5.0,4.8756

When I went it was memorial day so it was quite busy, but even then I did not have to wait very long. The empire state was also VERY close to my hotel and we had dinner twice in a restaurant that is located right under the empire state building. It was a very memorable view, thank you NY!!",5.0,4.6382

8589,Too expensive to go to the top,"Really wanted to go to the top for the view; however, we felt like forty dollars was not worth it. I’ve been in other tall buildings that did not charge that much. We ended up just taking pics inside the building.",3.0,3.7774
8590,Always a highlight,"This iconic building is still one of the best ways to view the city. although the customer journey has changed for the better, you still get a change to view the original hallway. from the top the views are, of course spectacular! a New York must",5.0,4.7766
8591,Amazing views!,Booking a Priority ticket online was easy and saved time on the day. The staff were friendly and efficient. The views were amazing and lived up to our expectations.

8594,Great experience,"I have visited the Empire State Building numerous times but had the joy of taking a family member for their first visit on this trip. I purchased tickets in advance online and we were at the top in no time at all. We also visited another observatory in the city on this trip but both agreed that the Empire State Building was our best experience. Part of that is due to the history and legacy of this building, but we also valued the pride, class, and congeniality demonstrated by the Empire staff. Well done!",5.0,4.9498
8595,Awesome spot and great view,"At first I wanted to visit ESB in the dark, but visit during the day paid off! No waiting in lines and perfect view. Nobody should miss the Empire State Building when in NYC!",5.0,3.8936
8596,Nice view over the city,"Wow, what an amazing view from the Empire State Building.

8597,The bogey man,"Quite good. Preferred the One World Trade Centre. The staff there were very welcoming. One youngish man on the outside viewing was more interested in viewing the bogeys he had just picked out of his nose than answering our simple question. No smile, no eye contact",3.0,4.6332

8607,Obstructed views... Not worth it,"Visited Empire State Building last week on a nice, windy day. The views of NYC are obstructed with cages. Although it was nice to see, there are no good photo ops and the cages ruin the experience. I understand the need for safety but feel clear windows would be much better, especially for the price of admission. I visited Top of the Rock the same morning before coming to Empire and hands down, would recommend Top of the Rock 100% over Empire. The views are much better and are not obstructed at all.",1.0,4.9314

8618,VIP Experience Totally Worth It,We bought tickets for the Empire State Building VIP Experience. The reason I bought them was because I wasn't sure what the weather would be like during our trip.

Great views from the 86th floor observatory but for us a rainy day decreased the visibility which ground staff kindly informed us if we wanted to go up. In a clear day the view must be spectacular. The gift shop has a lot of things to buy as well some staff on sale. As it was a rainy day there were few people visiting the building so the express tickets we bought was a rather waste of money as we went upstairs very quickly due to the absence of queue. Definitely worth visiting but pick up a sunny day to make the most.,4.0,4.9698
8675,The view on the city from here is a m u s t,"Coming early enough ¥ou will never be really alone, but you have a god opportunity to get and overview of Manhattan and with a bit sun and a tele of the camera you will discover a lot",5.0,4.5602
8676,"Of course it is a must see, but it could be better","Once on the observation deck, it is a stunning view from all sides of the building, and I have to say we thought the $40 elevator ride was worth it. However it is fairly Disney-esque in getting to the deck, with no chances wasted in monetizing each step of the way. Even leaving the place is rigged to force you through the gift shop before exiting!",4.0,3.3022
8677,Best Deal,Best thing we did was to purchase skip the line tickets for ESB. The lines were long but everyone there recognized the express option for our tickets. It works both going up and coming down which saved us hours. We went at dusk to see NYC at Sunset and at night. The weather was perfect on the night we went and the views are amazing! The city lights up! There are a lot of people so you have to be patient and squeeze up to get a front row view. This is one of the highlights of our visit.,5.0,4.9184
8678,Excellent !,"I went by night, it was awesome. I bought the VIP Express ticket online few days before going, it was useful even if there wasn't a lot of people waiting for the line.

8681,Excellent views,"A typically tourist-y thing to do, but a must-see if you like views of cities at all! We went in the morning of a sunny, clear day and we could see for miles! The views are excellent, you can walk round the 79th and then the 81st floor observations decks and will probably end up taking a lot of photos! I would say take a jacket and tie your hair back if it's long as it is pretty windy up there! Expect to spend an hour or so (if no queues) and try and get there early to skip the queues.",5.0,4.9239999999999995
8682,Disclaimer: my blood sugars were high,The views from the Empire State are impressive but I was very much underwhelmed after being at the Top of the Rock the day before. It was a clear night so visibility was good but I think I would recommend doing Top of the Rock in the day and at night over going up the Empire State.,3.0,4.8944

8684,Expensive but Beautiful,"I had a little sticker shock that it was $80 for 2 of us to get to the top. We could only go to the 86th floor because they are renovating the other observation deck. The process moved very quickly from buying our tickets, going through security and getting on an elevator to the 79th floor. It was crowded so they were allowing people to walk up to the 86th floor which was quite a trek if not in shape, but once on top the views were more than worth it. We spent about an hour and 45 minutes there from start to finish (we were trying to get back to the hotel to shower for dinner and a show). It was crowded outside on the observation deck but people moved along and you could get a spot up along the outside. It was a gorgeous Saturday afternoon on Memorial Day weekend. We took some great pics and it was a great way to kick off our NYC trip.",5.0,4.9512

8693,Great Visit at Night,"I went a couple years ago and waited in line probably two hours. This year, it took maybe 15 minutes to get to the top. I would highly recommend going at night.

While it may not be the tallest any longer, it’s an institution in New York, and along with the Chrysler Building was The skyscraper In previous times. The views from the top are still eye popping, but there is some renovation being done there currently, but do not miss this. The elevator ride is very entertaining!",5.0,4.445
8698,Best way to buy a ticket.,"Ok when you check the net you are bombarded with prices so no one knows what to do. We were just walking past and there wasn’t much of a queue so a street vendor sold us a skip a ticket for 40 dollars, went quickly through security and after waiting about 15 mins we were on the viewing platform. So my advice is don’t panic and just turn up. If it is really busy everybody has skip the line tickets anyway.",5.0,2.2502
8699,Stunning views over NYC,Outstanding views over the city. Went up at about 21:30 and had magnificent views over the light up New York. Had the New York pass so it was included in the price of my pass with the skip the line perk also included.,5.0,4.672

And this building was built in 1931 with the technique of that time!!
Are you crazy??!!
It's probably going to be faster and safer today, but then it was a real challenge.

God bless the people who built this miracle with the work of their two hands !!

The exhibition captivates itself and can even be seen in the lives of the workers. Who was on duty and what was the progress plan for that day.

8705,Great view from 86th floor,"It is very popular to do during your trip in NY, the line was very short and less than 15 minutes waiting time. The price is too high, if your are a family of 5 it is too much money for the experience.",3.0,3.9508
8706,My favourite attraction in New York,"This was my favourite attraction in New York... The Empire State Building was simply amazing!

It’s very simple to find, we used the Subway and google maps to locate the building. We invested in the city pass and it was totally worth the money. We skipped the queues and headed to the top of the building.

Please note that you will go through an airport security like search when reaching the top.

Before you get in the elevators there is lots of things to see and learn about the construction of the building.

The views from the top are truly amazing, I was in complete awe standing there taking in the whole views of New York.

If you’re in NYC then this is certainly something you need to go and experience you will not regret it!

Without doubt, the best views of NY, I was amazed by the view from the top, at how massive the city is, as far as the eye can see, urban and conurbation of towns. Important to pick a clear day.

A well worth visit.
It's not cheap though.",4.0,4.8052

8713,Empire State Building,A great experience well worth the visit and the views over New York are amazing. The staff are friendly and helpful. I would certainly go again.,5.0,4.9201999999999995
8714,A treat with some waiting and selfies EVERYWHERE,"Like most people who travel to New York , a trip to the top of the Empire State Building was on the list. The weather delayed our trip with cloud cover meaning no one was advised to go up to the viewing area. 2 days later we tried on a clear day and glad we did as the views are amazing.

This remains a good experience for all people with good access points for those with mobility issues but once in the viewing areas , it's everyone for themselves , which is sad. The constant lines for everything, despite it being quiet in the middle of the day was strange as was the need for several people just standing around who really were just standing around as they did not move once the the entire time we where there. Staff and barriers where placed to the front door; to the lifts; to the viewing area, to anywhere. They also insist you following all the barrier lanes and tape put up even if there is one one else who is walking the way you are. Protocol for the sake of no one wanting to reduce the unused lanes and delays in moving around the area was just lazy.

Oh - Why did I mention Selfies ? It due to the amazing amount of people who block walkways; the windows and corners of the viewing area for that ""one in a million"" shot of them viewing out into New York Harbor or the New York skyline. Be prepared for the complaints about you ruining their photos just by walking past.",3.0,1.3852

The rest of the group were fine with heights so loved it.",5.0,4.8802

8724,Get Ready To Queue,"Arrived mid morning out side queue length was already 2 hours long so decided to come back following day at 0800 hrs when doors open!

Following day straight in but still took 20 minutes to get to the top as there are several queues etc as follows:

1. Queue on street to main building door.
2. Queue to get tickets.
3 . Queue for security.
4. Queue for ticket check.
5. Queue for first lift that takes you to the first viewing platform ⅔ the way up.
6. Queue for second lift.
7. Queue to get onto top viewing area.

Once at the top the view is amazing although a little tarnished at this view has been so photographed over the years it’s nothing new. A bit disappointed but it’s a bucket list tick and still worth the journey!",5.0,4.9332
8725,Great visit,"We were very fortunate to visit on a clear and beautiful day. It’s amazing how windy it was up there and fascinating to view the city from that perspective.

Used a City pass to gain access. The lift has a great visual roof to help with the feel of climbing that high up.

We walked the last 8 floors as the queue for the lift was crazy, which was good fun although tiring 😂

The staff on the outside viewing area area lovely and really helpful in answering questions.

It's not that you don't look up at the building beaming with NY pride, it's just the trek is exhausting. By the time you get to the top, you're wondering if the view was worth it. And as soon as ""those people get out of the way,"" maybe you'll find out.",3.0,3.7636

8731,OK but be prepared to queue....,"We took advice from a New Yorker and did this in the daytime, and then went to Top of the Rock at sunset when you can actually see the lights come up over the city and the ESB light up, and also see Central Park,which you can't see from here. We had a New York Pass which allegedly gave us a fast track pass. IT DID NOT!!! We queued for 90 mins to get through security and ticketing and this was a mid-week visit out of season. Fast track pass is double the standard price. Once you are up the history part is interesting. Do not make the mistake we made and skip it thinking you can come back - you cannot. They force you round in a line to take a certain route. The views are nice enough but it's just a tower really. If you have to choose between Top of the Rock and ESB, skip ESB. If you have never been up, maybe do it as it is there but be ready to be standing for a LONG time. There are no seats ANYWHERE, even at the top, to stop you ""loitering"". 6 out of 10.",3.0,4.6672

We found out there was then asked if there was anywhere that came recommended to eat in the neighbourhood.

My mistake I admit. But the staff at the ticket booth were more than helpful, they called the people at the site I ordered my tickets from and got them to email my voucher to them. So we were able to see the wonderful sites of Manhattan at night from the top of the Empire State. Thank you to the most co-operative staff I have ever met. We were just sorry that we forgot their names, but we visited on Sunday night the 7th of April, so if you were on the ticket booth and you were the duty Manager that night?

8741,Try to visit at quieter times,"This beautiful and iconic building provides a must-do experience with regard to the wonderful views it provides. We visited on a Saturday evening, whilst the evening turned into night, providing a stunning, glittering view of the city. This experience should have felt magical, romantic etc, but the volume of visitors and the way we were herded along corridors and crushed into lifts, made the experience feel rather stressful and claustrophobic. The crush on the observation desk made it difficult to take pictures and, once we’d shuffled and been semi-pushed around the deck once, we felt obliged and relieved to go down.
I’m surprised that they don’t sell timed tickets. At around €40 a head for adults, this makes it a very expensive and potentially stressful experience for families. I’d definitely recommend visiting out of peak times, or paying more for a tour if you can afford it.",3.0,3.1288

Lines slightly longer, but, the staff kept things moving. The view at night is something to see. I live in Las Vegas, so I have seen city lights before. This blows that away.

8812,Nice place to see,"Of course, everyone knows the Empire State building and it's really nice to go up there. We had the C3 pass to go through the fast lane as well. The staff was really helpful. However I feel like outside it would be nice to make signs towards the observatory. Our Lyft dropped us off at the opposite site and the staff was really helpful guiding us the way, but I can imagine this could be kind of confusing when you come later in the day",4.0,4.3808

8823,Disappointing,"Was quite disappointed and underwelmed by my visit to ESB. Were taken up what seemed like the emergency exit stairs as work currently being done one the building. This in itself cant be helped but wasnt very well monitored; too many people crammed on the stairwells, it didnt feel safe at all. Also I think they should limit the number of people they let up at once, as was impossible to appreciate the view with so many people crammed in. I appreciate it's a busy attraction but I'm sure people wouldnt mind a longer wait if it meant their experience was more enjoyable.",2.0,4.8334

8827,Holiday,Wow what an amazing building and when you get to the top the views are one best views in the world of the NYC city skyline. It's breathtaking views are worth clicking and capturing for memories. If you hold a city pass you can go back in the evening to catch the night views of the city's skyline. The staff are friendly through the entrance to the top of the building. A must do when you are visiting NYC.,5.0,4.9404
8828,Gotta see NY this way!,Smooth entry though a bit of a way. But worth the views and the memories of the many films that featured this building. Just wish I could have entered like 20 yrs ago when the main elevators were the entry point. But sadly 9/11 changed everything.,5.0,4.3304
8829,Web Express Tickets,Express tickets were expensive but helpful in shortening the wait although it was not that busy in early May. During busier times would be worth the cost.

8833,Much more fun to see at night,"While this isn't the best views of the NYC skyline, it's a must for any first timers to Manhattan. I highly recommend going at night as there are less people (and subsequently it isn't as hot or stuffy when you're waiting to get to the elevators), less line waiting, and more spots to take photos in. Also, the NYC skyline generally looks better at night and the Empire State Bldg is open until I think 1 am, giving you lots of opportunity to make your way over there in the evening.",4.0,4.5194

8837,"Pictures are too expensive!!! 26 $ for a picture already printed, waste of paper and no one buy it","Of course the view is beautiful, you have to go there early (open at 8am) or late at night so that you don't have to wait. But what is shameful is that the pictures at the end are too expensive and I don't understand why, they would do more benefits by selling them 10$ each cause they will sell 3 times more.
The visit otherwise is great",1.0,4.6486
8838,Disappointed,"In the age of flight, the view from the top, in my opinion is now overrated for 39.20 US dollars. As an international visitor, I wasn't familiar with the skyline and couldn't excitedly point out landmarks, except for the Chrysler building. Also the weather was not pleasant during my visit. A single photo was 26 US dollars. They do have those binoculars at the top which was fun to use.",3.0,3.254

I took my family who were visiting from overseas last weekend ..... it was a complete disaster.....way too much crowd and the official ushers were totally insensitive to crowd control .... I saw couple of guys on the top deck .... who were supposed to be directing and controlling the crowd, watching videos on his cell phone all the time .... more than 30 mins!! The blame should be on the management ..... they are letting in too much crowd than the observatory deck can handle .... not bothering about the tourist experience.

We thought we would have to wait a while before going up or may have even to knocked back due to not booking in advance.

8877,Top of NYC,"Went on top of ESB on a rainy and very cold day last week. It was an awesome sight across the NYC. The views are very good.
Everything is overpriced in New York. But going to NYC and not going on top of the building is missing something.
A possible alternative is No1 WTC but I understand they don't allow you to come out of the top floor which Empire State Building does.",4.0,4.0838
8878,Great view of NY,"Lines,lines,lines. Avoid by turning up early. We arrived just after 8.00 am when it opened and breezed through security and the lift up.

In the 45 minutes we were up there it had started to become crowded, so go early!",5.0,4.5132
8879,top of the empire,visited this place late in the evening 10pm . Small cues at that hour of the night. well worth the visit - views not to be missed at nighttime.,5.0,4.1956
8880,An expensive not memorable place,"I recognize that I didn't know anything about the top of Empire state, but, i imagine that we can eat, or drink something up there, an have a great moment with the view. But, is a expensive ticket to get the top and there is nothing, no chairs, no music, no nothing, just a terrace with a view, an spectacular one, but just that. And, the day we go up, was so mucha wind and cold that was mostly impossible to stand out side. I think that will be kind of you to tell us before paid tickets.
I wouldn't come back, i certainly look for another roof top",2.0,4.8624
8881,Incredible Experience,"A must do for any visit to New York. The whole experience was amazing, all staff were incredibly helpful & knowledgeable.

8887,Skip The Line -WORTH IT!!,"Concierge at our hotel suggested “skip the line” access for our Empire State Building visit and it is SO totally worth the extra $$! We were visiting during a particularly rainy week, and the day we had access to the Empire State building was the first sunny day. The lines were painfully long, our skip the line access took us straight to the red carpet and, I’m sure those standing in line did not appreciate it, we went to the red carpet, a dedicated elevator to ascend and descend! (Yep, there’s a line to get back down, too!) Terrific views - even if the higher observation floor was closed- we had beautiful views all around.

Get your tickets early and in advance. It can sell out!",5.0,4.867

I saw the Brooklyn Bridge, One world building, and even the statue of liberty.
I felt greatness of the US.
The waiting time was not so long, and all the staff were very friendly.",5.0,4.633
8930,"Love the landmark, tour needs a bit of attention","I've always loved the ESB and enjoy it being such an iconic part of the cityscape. The building itself is a beautiful example of the architecture of the day and the vantage points give an excellent bird's eye view of the city, all around. I found the staff to be pleasant but somewhat robotic (understandable, having to repeat themselves all day long), and I would have enjoyed a bit more genuine human input.

Where the tour needs attention is:
- I downloaded the app and tried to download the English language audio tour but there was no way it would work. None of the staff I approached had any idea how to help with this.
- The signage and directions are not that clear so I felt like I was fumbling my way through. I didn't even realise when we got in the elevator after viewing the city from the interior that we were heading UP. I thought the tour was finished. But we went up to a higher floor, where the exterior viewing point is and that was great.

I went at a time when there were no long lines (3pm on a week day) so was happy about that. I really think there could be more of a guided tour, explanations, more multimedia delivery of information and so on.

Ultimately, I did enjoy exploring what I could of the ESB, as majestic and iconic as she is.",4.0,4.9702
8931,Fabulous!,Fabulous! We enjoyed our visit. They were friendly and the views were magnificent! We went in May and we had no line ups going up. On the way down we had to lineup but that was because a school group had come in and we got behind them.

There are 6 Stations with App commentary, (eg Ellis Island, Liberty Island), well worth listening to. Staff were friendly and helpful. We had a sunny day. Loved this building and history!!!

8938,Don’t buy tickets in advance!!,My wife and I bought our tickets about two months ahead of our trip and about a week before the trip my wife found out she could not go. They offer no refund under any circumstance for any reason so therefore don’t buy your tickets in advance. I basically spent $84 to go up the Empire State building alone for 10 minutes. It is incomprehensible in this day and age where computers can process payments and refunds instantaneously that they don’t offer a refund with a weeks notice of one person not being able to show up.,2.0,2.0122

It was not the best experience & we had to constantly wait for people to take their photos before accessing the views. It appeared that people were more interested in taking photos than enjoying the views. I'd suggest visiting this attraction in the evening, or find an alternative viewpoint, of which there are many. Of course it is an iconic building, but for me, over-rated & not worth the wait.",3.0,3.6202

While in Herald Square, a person was selling mutli-museum passes for a good price so we bought them. The observatory on the 102nd floor is closed until July so you can only go as high as the 86th floor. The elevators are fast and you don't even feel like you are going that high up.
The view from there is absolutely breathtaking. Don't miss it.",5.0,4.6706

So, if you've never visited before and you're reading up on this to try to decide if you need to buy the ""skip the llines"" ticket, you won't need it if you go at night on a weekday. We went on a Monday night. We ate dinner in the State Grill and Bar (wonderful food, a little pricey). And then we went to the 86th Floor. It was about 8:30 p.m. or so when we went up. There were no lines at all. We got on the elevator with no waiting. The view was breathtaking. It's a little windy up there, so if it's cold, be sure to wear a jacket. Well worth doing!",5.0,4.7644

We decided to go at night for something different to do as we had seen so many attractions during the day - to see the city all lit up is beautiful. We visited the 102nd floor and it doesn't look much different from the views of the 86th but we thought 'why not?' as it wasn't much more expensive to go to the very top - I can say I have been to the very top of the Empire State Building!

8973,"Great attraction, great views","Really enjoyed visiting the Empire State Building. Appreciated being left to soak up the views for as long as I wanted, since there are no time limits once inside the building. And the views are spectacular! Only negative was the attitude of the security guard who wouldn't let us take two minutes to put our belts, wristwatches etc back on after going through the airport-style metal detector.",4.0,4.1394
8974,Never a disapointment,"The VIP pass is well worth the cost as you get to zip through all the lines, and there are several lines you have to wait in. Even the exit process allows you instant access to the down elevators. My only suggestion is you should print your ticket and not rely on your mobile device to display the QB code correctly. You can print your ticket from a kiosk in the lobby.",5.0,4.5966000000000005
8975,VIP Premier Tour Experience,"From the moment we arrived at the Empire State Building (ESB) and the warm welcome we received from Tara, who introduced us to our VIP tour guide Siobhan M, just set a very special tone for our visit. Siobhan M was so enthusiastic and knowledgeable about ESB, taking us through the history and showing us some of the hidden secrets of the building as we walked through the different floor levels. A really nice touch was being introduced to other ESB employees who shared their knowledge and humour as part of our tour.
Siobhan M made our visit so enjoyable and fun. I believe the M in Siobhan's name must stand for Magical. I would really recommend the VIP Premier Tour experience to everyone.

Its well worth an hour or so of your day.",4.0,4.8986
8987,Very good views but overpriced and crowded,"You get stunning views over Manhattan, I think that's obvious. However I think asking $30 per person when they get thousands of visitors every day is just daylight robbery!
There doesn't seem to be any control over how many people are going up so the top is just packed and you can barely move.
Last thing, we had to queue for longer to come down as everyone gets a bit stranded at the top!",2.0,4.4924
8988,ESB,"The view was a little foggy and was lightly raining. The employees let everyone know that the view wasn't clear. But, it was still amazing.

8995,Empire State observatory,well worthwhile for an excellent view of the city. had to queue for a while though and it wasn't always clear .

There is airport style security as you enter and on busy days this seems to be where the queues build up. Sadly your queue-buster ticket won’t make any difference at this stage. The views from the top are amazing, you can see so far! It’s also intriguing to see the tops of buildings that are more familiar at street level. But as well as the views, please take time to look at the building itself as you go through. They are carrying out renovations at the moment and the completed areas are just stunning, so beautiful! It is elegant and stylish inside and out, a real gem.",5.0,4.9626

9000,Disappointed,"We went there at 10 pm and it was too foggy to see anything. So yeah, we didn't see a thing.
I mean, it's not their fault BUT why do you sell tickets and allow people to go up there knowing there's no view. This is absurd, you should tell people about it and recommend them to come next day/time, not throwing their money away for nothing.

The same thing happened to us when we went to the Top of the rock observation deck, and they actually told us that THERE's no view today! So they changed our tickets, just as simple as that.",1.0,4.1899999999999995
9001,A good visit - but not small child/family friendly,"We enjoyed the visit, but found the whole process to be not family/children friendly. Not many baby chaning facilities, not pram friendly.

From the security outside the building, to the well lit, informative and interesting displays and pictures - it is a pleasant experience, leaving one with a satisfied feeling of having visited a historical landmark.

Unfortunately, on the day of my visit, the weather was terrible, making visibility IMPOSSIBLE. However, due to other displays, pictures and models within the building - one is still able to visit the landmark, and not go upstairs,. yet feel satisfied.

Will be back!",5.0,4.9322

There isn’t much information on where to pay/queue or where to go if you already have a ticket. Also there isn’t any indication of how long you are likely to be waiting in the queue, and on the day we visited there was bad weather the day before so the queues were longer than normal.",4.0,4.0534
9013,Evening visit to Empire State,"We came to the ESB entrance about 6pm and there was no line at the ticketing machines, even though there were many people waiting to go up.
A word of caution: double-check when you are purchasing the tickets at the machine. I have paid for two tickets, but received only one ticket and a receipt from the machine, so we have had some issues later when we tried to pass to the elevators. The staff said it happened often, but they did not know exactly what to do in that case. In the end, we were let go through the gate.",5.0,2.6938
9014,Fantastic views - lots of queuing!,"We visited the Empire State building as part of the New York pass deal we had. Finding the right entrance was our first hurdle, then we spent about an hour in various queues and airport style security checks.

It was well worth the effort however; the views from the top were spectacular - just make sure you go on a sunny day!",3.0,4.8268
9015,ESB May 2019,"We were there for 8 o'clock in the morning as it was the first day in our 6 day stay that there was no low cloud obscuring the top of the building. Because of this it was already very busy, but the line moved fairly quickly. It was therefore busy on the observation deck but we still managed to get decent photos despite the crowd. Would possibly advise an early visit but cannot comment on how busy it gets during the day. A visit here is obviously very much weather dependent and we found that New York weather can be very extreme.",5.0,2.6198

We were escorted (by the super courteous and professional staff) like kings & queens to the front of every line along the way to the top. Avoiding the long waits made for a much better experience, especially when you have impatient kids (and adults) and it's late at night and everyone's tired from trotting around the Big Apple all day. The views at the top are indescribable (you must see to believe), and I always enjoy night visits rathe than day time since the thousands of twinkling lights add to the magic. With a cool breeze in our hair, looking down over the majestic city, so loud down below, but up top, all you hear is a light hum of traffic 860 feet below. Highly recommended. Sure, it seems touristy at first glance, but it is a must see experience we'll never forget. Plus you get a photo of your party green-screened against a panoramic night time view of Gotham below.

While you go with the elevators, go thru the halls and corridors, see those little perks of old times. And the deck itself, just classic as you know and expect from movies, but now I can walk around and look in the oculars! I'm just so happy I went there. It can get crowded in the deck especially around sunset. Little trick - ask people to make them pictures. Make them few pictures and if they are polite enough they will let you on their spot and make pictures for you as well.

The general entrance that goes up to the 86th floor DOES NOT skip the queues

So we upgrade our tickets for the 'priority' one, which weren't cheap, but it saved us lots of time.
With these tickets we have been at the top in 15 min!!!!

However, do note that there is a barbed wire fence at the 86th floor so you'll have to take the photos in between the barbed wire. The spaces are large enough that it isn't a problem, but it might obstruct the view if you take it from a distance. You have to be careful if you're taking a photo to avoid the wire, otherwise take the photos from a safe distance! Other places have glass walls that don't have this problem.

We did this at night and the views were amazing!! The ques to get to lifts to come down were long but we were able to go straight into the next lift with priority passes and into the gift shop. All gift shops sell the same tat but in there it somehow seems to be much better quality. The building is amazing and is highly recommended.,5.0,4.9636
9069,86th Floor WOW,"Plan ahead and purchase skip the queue passes as not only do bypass everyone on the way up but also the way down.
We tried to go up on our first day in New York however the cloud base was low so there would have been no view so do not leave until your last day just in case. We then went back on a clear day and wow what a view of the City. We ended up on the 86th floor which you can go higher but the area was under renovation , still great views.
All the staff were jolly and gave you info even though we didn’t ask which was very good and informative.
Visiting this iconic landmark is a must.",5.0,4.9412
9070,ESB visit,"We booked our tickets prior to visiting NYC. On the day (weekday)we visited there were minimal queues and we were able to go straight up. The 102nd floor was not open so we could not pay the extra money to get a ticket for this floor. The historical building and views were well worth seeing, and it would be foolish not to visit it.",4.0,3.952
9071,A view never to be missed,"The Empire State Building is beautiful, from the very top you can see all around for miles over New York, the day we visited was extremely windy at the top but nevertheless a sight never to be missed.
I would recommend purchasing your tickets before you go, we had the tickets that allow you to miss the queue, we were taken straight to the lift with no waiting time, definitely a must!
It is also good to go both day & night as the nighttime view with New York in lights is stunning to see.",5.0,4.9296
9072,Great views,"The views were great. The wait was very long. This for me is a must see place, however once seen I don’t think I would go back.",4.0,4.2498000000000005
9073,Always a Treat to go up the Famous Art Deco Empire State Building. my first time was in 1960,"Just down to NYC by train from Montreal. On my last visit I did the new World One Building at the World Trade Center, this visit it was the old classic world famour Skyscraper, at one time the tallest building in the World.. It Was fairly crowded on the Viewing Terrace.. at the 86 stories level.. the top observation Dome was closed for renovations, it's expected to reopen in late August.. Beautiful landmark building.. Lots of touristy stores selling all sorts of Empire State building, China made Tourist stuff..",4.0,4.0534
9074,Almost a shocking experience,"We had a prepaid ticket, so had to visit on a 2 day visit to New York. Express lift to viewing area. Many interesting facts on display on the interior walls, for example total build cost $26 Million, including $5000 on a soda fountain!. Couldn't see a thing outside, due to the weather. Allowed to go outside on platform to savour the New York fog. Whilst outside, lightning conductor struck by lightning, certainly the loudest I have ever heard. Hasty retreat back into the building. Fairly certain I heard a voice from the heavens say 'Aw shucks, get you next time' One of the lady observatory attendants said it was the loudest strike they had in 15 years. All I could do to stop them dialling 911. Great visit, and will return next time in New York!",5.0,4.786
9075,Must visit while in NYC,We went to visit at night as we wanted to see NYC lit up. We were not disappointed amazing views. Take a coat though it was cold and windy. I found the photo they took at the end very expensive,4.0,2.7348
9076,Very crowded,We queued for over an hour to visit here and it was very crowded and hard to take a good photo without being jostled. We were disappointed ☹️. However speaking to others we agreed that it was unfortunate that we had visited after a very rainy weekend so the queues in that day were a lot longer. If we had waited and gone another day it might have been better.,3.0,2.7658
9077,"Glorious night views, open until 2am","As two adults, we visited after 10pm on a weekday. At this time there was no wait to purchase tickets or take the elevator to the outdoor observation floor. Highly recommend the views at night. Lots to choose from in the gift shop afterward.",5.0,4.0826
9078,Amazing views...a must when in New York!,"I’ve been to the top of this building many times. It’s been updated over the years but nothing changes the amazing views from the top.

Was a great visit. Highly recommend. We tried top of the rock earlier in the day but it was fully booked.
Enjoy.",5.0,4.8258
9083,Ok view,Not the most impressive view. It is not high enough. The ticket costs over $42. For me personally it not worth it.,3.0,1.8898
9084,Empire State,"Visited the Empire State building and it was very quiet. No que at all.
Lovely building and a breathtaking view of New York from the 86th floor.
Souvenier shop in the building is worth a visit and some items reasonably priced.
Art deco within the building is beautiful.",5.0,4.757
9085,DO NOT BUY THE EXPRESS PASS!!!,"The views are amazing. I was with my daughter and we were trying to get as much done as possible. I almost booked the skip the lines pass as I didn't want to wait in lines. After reading a few reviews I decided to wait and see what the lines were like once we got there. We went on a beautiful Tuesday and the line was NONEXISTENT. Maybe it would be a good thing on the weekend or during a holiday but if we would have bought that option it would have been a waste of $70 dollars.

I will say my 8 year old daughter was disappointed we didn't get to walk on the red carpet! :-)

The view itself is amazing with beautiful views in all directions. I debated between Top of The Rock and Empire and I am so glad we decided to go with the Empire State Building",5.0,4.942
9086,Iconic Building and Observation Deck a MUST SEE!,"The skyline of New York City would be dismal without the Empire State Building. This iconic building can be seen from street level and is a beacon. With changing colour themes, the ESB lights up the sky and honours various agencies daily.

We enjoyed the Empire State Building, utilized the CityPass for admission, with both day and night views. The ESB is unlike Top of The Rock which allocates timed entry. The ESB is a first come, first served venue. Line up and everyone is passed through security and ticket vending machines deal with tickets. FYI the QR (quick response) codes on cell phones are not easily read by the machine. Utilizing the QR code ticket held up the lines and attendants were required to proceed. They were not quick.

We ascended to the top twice on the same day. We arrived at 11:30am and at 9pm. The procedure is identical at all hours and the time through was basically 2 hours round trip in mid-April. It's a well run machine.

The views from the observation deck are amazing. This is a highly sought after venue and visitors are overflowing, day or night. We found all visitors courteous and happy. The night skyline twinkled and viewing the city from above was magical. We were in NYC!

If you are expecting an empty deck, like in Sleepless in Seattle, arrive extra early or in off season. That's not happening this time of year!

Highly recommend purchasing the day and night ticket. A different feel during both visits. If you are time pressed, go up during the night. It's AMAZING!",5.0,4.9662
9087,Great view on a clear spring day,Visited the observatory floor early one morning in April. Weather was nice...slightly overcast day but with great visibility. Lines moved efficiently and only took us maybe 10 -15 minutes to get to the observation floor. We were there around 10:00 am so crowds were lower than later in the day. Plenty of space to walk around the outside observation area. I'm afraid of heights but as long as I didn't lean up against the sides to look out I was fine. Beautiful building and the staff guiding you along each step were courteous and helpful.,4.0,4.9483999999999995
9088,To do !,"We went to Empire State Building, One World Observatory and Top of The Rock, and ESB is still the one to do if you have no time to do the others. We went soon, so not many people.

Pros : THE view, iconic place, the reception, not too ""touristy"". No transparent panels, so you can take very good pics.

Cons : none.",5.0,4.1384
9089,New York holiday,"Visited the Empire state building as part of the New York trip. Used an attraction pass to Dave money. Luckily on the day, there were absolutely no queues. Did wonder if it would be worth it having already been to the TOTR and OWO. Have to say it was a highlight on the trip, yes you're seeing a view you've already seen, but the interior made it worth it, something the other 2 lack. Only fault is the superimposed picture of fare too expensive to buy, but this seems the case across all the sights.",5.0,3.1306
9090,you have to do it!,"so, you have a choice, Empire, the Rock, or world trade! do all 3? maybe, but if you only do one, do the Empire State! Once you're there, its so iconic, its organised, we only waited 15 minutes, its reasonably priced, $76. for 2.",5.0,3.0

9095,Amazing! Spectacular at night and no lines,"We visited 10pm right after a night-time thunderstorm which cleared the air wonderfully and gave us amazing night views in all directions. There was no line and the outside viewing gallery was busy but not overcrowded.

The staff were helpful and courteous and directed us to the next elevators etc. The process was very smooth and well-run and the inside of the building was spotless and beautiful.

From the 86th floor it is terrifying to look down if you’re scared of heights! But even my mum managed to go to the railing and look out. The views were simply a once in a lifetime experience.",5.0,4.7068
9096,Must see,"We visited ESB about 1 pm,bought ticket online and there was no lines,very smoothy wal-in inside. Interesting atmosphere with many information about building and amazing view to all sides from top. Outside is really windy-javkets recommended!",5.0,4.6324000000000005

No queues.... straight in straight up.... oh my goodness... I appreciate it’s not the highest or most state of the art but probably the most iconic..... love love loved it.....
If you only do one high rise in NYC do this one. My wife is petrified of heights.... hence the cocktail onslaught.... you don’t need long at the top.... enough to appreciate this city Jem...

So what can I say get a ticket and view the Art Deco splendour of the building and enjoy the experience",5.0,4.922
9101,Worth it,"It is the Empire State Building after all, so you pretty much have to do the top observation deck if the weather allows. That said, unless you want to stand in a line to stand in another line, to get penned waiting to pass through security to join another line to get to the 72nd floor, and at least one more to get to the 86th deck, the express pass is the answer. You do get the views you expect, and so whats not to love? Answer, the staff. Many appear annoyed to be there at all, and unless you ask questions each step of the way, you end up in the regular line. The express line path is pretty much the same, and nothing is marked. A special thumbs down to the security staff who were not at all impressed that my SO has a pace maker. Never been to any venue before were we both felt mistreated because of a pace maker.",4.0,4.2918
9102,AMAZING !,"We visited the Empire State Building at midnight. It was fantastic ! Very quiet and calm. As the weather was nice and the sky clear, we had an amazing view on the city.
One of our best experiences in NYC !",5.0,4.929
9103,Has to be done.,"On our third attempt to get to the top ( weather conditions ) it was well worth it. You can see everything for miles, good to do once you've visited other sights so you can recognise them. As for how high you have to see it to believe it!",4.0,4.5802
9104,Empire State Building VIP tickets,"Wow. What an experience. We had the VIP tickets, which let’s you jump long lines. Now, it was pretty packed on that day, but you really didn’t need to buy the expensive VIP tickets. We went around 6:45 pm there we wanted to see the sunset, which was amazing.
Once on top of the observatory, you get a great view and pictures is One World, Chrysler Building, Flatrion and Uptown and Downtown. Sad that you cannot get a good pic from the Central Park, but of course you can jump into a chopper $$$!
Trip is worth every penny- negative that you do not have the opportunity to sit someplace to relax legs or something...",4.0,4.9002
9105,Fine but the experience is not great,"I completely understand why people would want to go up this iconic building but I have to say the experience is pretty lacking. Long queues are expected but the space is tiny at the top, the mesh makes it hard to take photos and it’s very hard to get a prime spot as it’s rammed.

For a nicer experience and better view (as you get the Empire State in it) hit the top of the rock.",3.0,4.8732
9106,Great Views !,"Once upon a time this was the tallest building in the world ! Of course Burj Al Khalifa dwarfed them all. Having studied in school as the tallest building in the world, it was quite a nostalgic experience to be on top of it ! Though, there was a big line , especially at the second stage, the views compensated them all.",5.0,3.673
9107,A decent experience in spite of the weather,"We had opted to take in a night view of the city from the top of the Empire State Building, which sadly wasn't much of a night view due to the weather.
It was a good experience to visit and make the trip to the top nevertheless.
Unfortunately you can't book the weather as they say. Why the 3 rating? OK so I have only a comparison to the Freedom Tower to make. The difference between the two spots is that whilst the staff EVERYWHERE at One WTC gave the option to reschedule the tickets under the same situation, the staff at ESB did not. Thats my only reason I'm afraid. Both state that tickets cannot be rebooked in their T's and C's - I just felt that the staff at One WTC made a bit more of an effort to accommodate people.",3.0,4.6286000000000005
9108,Wonderful Views.,"The last time I visited here was when I was a young teenager. It what great going with my son, his girlfriend and her Mom. We went during the day and the line was long to get in. It seems you have to prepare yourself for that pretty much anywhere that is a tourist attraction nowadays. Once inside you have to put your jackets, sweaters, purses and other belongings into a tray like at the airport. The ride on the elevator was cool and you will see why (don't want to spoil the small surprise). The views were great. My only regret is that we didn't see the nighttime views with all of the city lights. Remember whenever going anywhere high up to bring something warm to wear and a cap if you don't want your hair blowing about. Nice place to visit and experience!",4.0,4.927

To go their again is top of our list for the next visit!",5.0,4.95
9114,STILL an iconic landmark!,"From the viewpoint of THIS native New Yorker, now living in California, introducing my daughter to the city I called HOME (OK, still DO), the Empire State Building is STILL the one iconic midtown experience to have. Yes, the tickets are pricey now, and the lines are long, but if you set aside the day for this, it's still a worthwhile experience.

9131,a classic MUST DO in NYC,"Had bought a new york explorer pass, but not really sure it helped going up quicker due to most visitors have a pass for this attraction...
Had hesitated to go there ot to TOP OF THE ROCK....eventually did both...
Had already been to the ESB, but 20 years ago and this time was there with my family and thought it would be nice for them to go there at least once....just love this building, its design is easilly recognizable and been there for so long...
of course, as it is a MUST DO, it is very crowded and not laways easy to get a nice spot with noone in front of you...must be a little patient to admire the views but it's worth it...at least you can see the Chrysler building (something that we can't do from the rockfeller center..or just a small part).
The negative points are the number of people visiting and thus, a waste of time queuing , plus security which slows down the process...but it's for our own protection so no problem with it.
Advise, go there as early as possible.
I also imagine that a sunset from up there must be great as well...
Enjoy the views!!",4.0,4.8476
9132,Unprofessional crew and management,"Tonight it was impossible to see a thing due to fog. Ticket lost for nothing and they perfectly know that visibility was very bad but continued to allow people enter and get to the top without saying a word or anouncing anything, so I think they seem to be only interested in money.

The lift up to the 79th floor is great, check out the ceiling as you go. There is an indoor area to look out over the city, you then get another lift up to the 86th floor and the outdoor observation deck.

You have to pass security (just like many other places) and then use a high-speed elevator to the 72nd floor. Here's an exhibition on the history of the construction of the building, which is quite impressive! Then there's another elevator to go the 86th floor. Here you'll find the outdoor observation deck. I'm not keen on heights, but found the views here magnificent, even with rather gloomy weather and limited visibility. The advantage was: no waiting lines and in+out in less than one hour :-)",4.0,4.7547999999999995
9147,"Too busy, factory tourism, just unpleasant.","Obviously there are magnificent views from the observation deck, although I preferred the Too of the Rock.

Couldn’t really enjoy it as I felt so dizzy. My daughter really enjoyed it though and these are her pics. Very busy at the top but not so bad you couldn’t see the views. Would recommend,4.0,4.905
9157,Great views 👀,"It would have thought for an attraction as big as this they would have some sort of system in place making exiting the building easier. We went on a Saturday afternoon, probably peak hour and it was horrific in the heat, there was nobody sorting the que so people were pushing in front of people who had been queuing a long time and there was far too many people up there to be able to enjoy the views without getting barged left right and center.

9161,Disappointing: Top of the Rock is better,"It was no doubt the busiest thing to do in New York but when you’re actually up there you’ll be lucky if you actually get to take any pictures. It’s what I would imagine being a battery hen in, shoved around by far too many people it’s surely a health and safety risk. The view at top of the rock is so much better and has views of the park and the Empire State Building and you aren’t rammed in like sardines in a tin you actually have space and time to breathe, take it all in, take pictures and just basque in the views for a bit. We queued for the ESB for longer than we were up there. You need a battering ram to get through people. Disappointing.",2.0,4.8260000000000005

So we took that option which was exhausting I saw one older gent really struggling and had to wait on the side which I didn’t think was right.

The exact entrance was not on Fifth Avenue but in a side street (W34th street I think).

We had priority status which cost extra online but were whisked past all the queues, saving a lot of waiting. There is a lot of security, scanners etc.

You go the the 79th floor in one lift then swap to another to go to the viewing platform. We went on a murky day but the views were amazing, worth the cost to experience this iconic piece of history. The winds at 1400 feet were strong.

We didn't actually see much of the building itself as it's mostly offices but what we did see was very stylish.

Probably a must see if you are visiting new York for the first time.",5.0,4.8884

9184,See the City at Night,The Empire State Building is a staple of NYC. It is a great way to see the city at night. The top of the building is small and can get crowded but it is an awesome view day or night. The building offers a great bit of history to NYC and is fun to visit.

9186,Birds Eye View Of NYC,"Visited here early on a Tuesday morning.It costs approx $35 each depending where you buy your ticket. We had no problem with Queues. The whole experience is very well laid out from the inviting and friendly staff to the brilliant elevator ride,( be sure to look up at the ceiling of the elevator)
The history of the building throughout construction and the photographs are really interesting. We visited the viewing deck on the 86th floor. There is an outdoor viewing balcony which is amazing. You have a 360 view of NYC.,The Hudson,, The Bridges, Liberty Island,Ellis Island , everything. Brilliant.
We also visited the gift shop while there. I thought things were a bit pricey but since we had travelled from Ireland i felt i should buy something. I am a big tea drinker and they had some lovely looking mugs with a picture of New York printed on them so i decided to buy two. I paid over $30 dollars only to find that my husbands one leaked and had to be thrown out immediately and mine probably wont last very long. It is very poorly glazed. . Very disappointing
However we had a great visit ti the ESB and i would definitely recommend it..",4.0,4.9498

It was a cloudy day when we purchased ours so decided to go back the next day. We was advised to go up at night time. So we did. As did half of other New York visitors!!!!
It took about an hour to get through security checks and up in the lift. It was very busy up there but great views as there usually is at the top of the towers. We had to fight to get to the front due to the masses of people but worth it none the less.",4.0,4.7804

9190,Very worthwhile,We went late afternoon which was great. We were trying to get there around the time of sun down but was there just a little too early and with kids couldn't hang around.

I have been there once earlier right on the top floor, and this was the second time I was at the Empire State Building. My husband was with me both the time but he didn't go on top during any of the time as he don't like heights! But, I always enjoy the tour!
However, this time I was very disappointed as the top floor, don't remember exactly perhaps 102nd floor which was closed for renovation! We were allowed to go up to 89th floor only which was very disappointed since I flew all the way from Europe to New York to go to the top floor!",5.0,4.0084

9194,Empire State Building,"First time visit to New York so clearly this one was top of the list to visit. It’s not a disappointment in any way, it’s just an amazing experience that you have to make part of you trip.
It’s pretty easy to get to, well you can’t really miss it. It is however, extremely busy and you need to get there early or you’ll spend ages in lines, for tickets and security.
We had New York passes, which in our opinion save you money, if you intend on doing all the top visits and tours that are available. This enables you to skip the line, but not security which understandably is lengthy and thorough.
Once inside, the shear size and beauty of this building kicks in. Well worth the $36 to get in. The lift ride is great and once into the second elevator, you can feel the excitement in people as you first get that awesome view of the city....and it is amazing. The views are incredible, all round, and as the city has progressed, there are a number of buildings that now tower above it, but few are as special. It does get very busy as you can imagine, but it’s a matter of shuffling around to get your ideal photo. It does get windy on a few sides and then you’ll need sun cream on the other, so be prepared for both.
Tips.
Go early, 8am, be up there before the crowds get huge.
Get a city pass, worth the money.
The souvenir shops expensive as is the food, so shop around.
Wear the right clothing up top, it can be cold, and windy as well as very warm in the sunshine.
Enjoy!!",5.0,4.9956

But the next areas line felt like forever. There are stairs you can take from this point but our feet were already tired from the day. When we got to the observation deck it was very crowded. I believe it was the first clear night in a few days. I felt overwhelmed by the crowd and I'm not very tall which doesn't help either. It was dark and crowded and many rude tourists. My family split up because there were too many people. Just too expensive for what you get. I dont think I would ever do this again. And if I could do it over would go when there was no crowd, either super early in the morning or super late at night on a clear day/evening. Thank goodness we got just the basic tickets",3.0,4.915

I was on crutches so was fast tracked for free. It gets busy at the top but all very civilised.

The lines were short and the queue system was very well organised with lots of helpful people pointing you in the right direction even on the street! We didn’t pre book tickets and avoided the touts outside and went straight up to the self serve ticket machines up the escalators. These were more expensive than the ones outside on the street... children under 12 are cheaper. The line took only 5 mins to get to the photo area (you can buy this green screen photo afterwards) then it was whizzing up the 82 floors to the indoor viewing area. The elevator is a fun experience - watch the ceiling! There was then a separate elevator line to get to the outdoor wrap around viewing platform on the 86 floor. Or you can skip the line and walk 4 floors instead, which we did. The views were well worth it in every direction. Plenty of opportunities for photos.

The views are exceptional and there are city lights as far as the eye can see. There are binoculars on the deck which allows you a closer look at buildings or streets (for free).

Make sure you go to either the Empire State Building or the Rockefeller Building during your visit, or even both - one during night and the other during the day?

Enjoy the views!",5.0,4.8596

40 dollar each adult not cheap but what views.",5.0,3.0
9234,A must when in NY,"We had a New York pass which the Empire state was included. Wow what a brilliant experience..
Loads of stories to listen to on the TV screens which the kids enjoyed.
As it's always busy in here you have a choice of walking up the stairs (5/6 floors) which we did and were knackered! Should have waited for the lift but no me being me said let's walk them last floors! Once we got to the top WOW what a brilliant view of NY.
When your in NY go see this beautiful building.",5.0,4.9592
9235,Famous landmark,"Firstly, I find the way the ticketing is done is not clear and they do not reply to emails. Secondly, the entrance to this place is a little unclear but they had staff pointing out where the entrance is, which helps. The lift ride was the highlight, with the video. It was a real cloudy day so we couldn't see much but nevertheless it was enjoyable. Too many people so it's hard to get a nice photo shot.",4.0,4.8038
9236,Dangerously Overcrowded,"We entered the building at 745pm on Sunday 21 April. Queues downstairs were ok, but the lines on the 80th were long. Staircases were opened for the final trip to 86th.

On arriving at the viewing deck we found ourselves in a major crush to get outside. I would classify the crowd control as dangerous. No one way systems in and out to the terrace. Staff did not have a control of the situation. One staff member was just standing by the door and could not make a single sentence without including a profanity.

Take my advice. Go to the Top of the Rock and One World Observatory to get great views of the city and Empire State Building. Avoid the Empire State building itself. The overcrowding and poor crowd control make it too dangerous.

The alternatives offer better views and much more comfort. Safer too.",1.0,3.4162

9239,Empire State Building VIP skip the line tickets,"My son and I visited the Empire State Building in April 2019. I purchased the VIP skip the line tickets in advance from Viator. It was not a busy day, so we probably would’ve been fine without them, but I am glad I got them. I have been there before when the lines were crazy long. If you’re going in the summer, I think they’re a must. You can purchase them there when to arrive.

I had been there a couple of times and they changed some things up. There’s a fairly new video on the elevator that is a nice distraction.

We had also done the One World Trade Center observation deck, and I debated whether to do the Empire State Building again, but glad I did. It’s a totally different view.",5.0,4.6898
9240,Breath Taking,every one should experience this stop. It would not be a trip complete without seeing the city from the top. Everyone was so friendly and helped us navigate to where we needed to go. A lot of construction around the buildings but they had people positioned to lead you to the entrance. The elevator ride to the first stop was so smooth and fast. Could not believe how fast we got to the stop.,5.0,1.7048

9245,"Amazing views, amazing experience","Wow! What can I say!!! The whole experience lived up to high expectations and then some!!! We got the AM/PM tickets as it was a first visit for myself, mum and 14 year old. My eldest visited earlier in year with college. We came from Cornwall,UK. Staff were extremely friendly but with an authority to keep the queues flowing like a slick machine. We loved the staff uniforms, lifts were insane and the views .... WOW!!! Definitely worth paying extra for AM/PM tickets. We didn’t even have the best weather at night but didn’t detract from the insane views all lit up. And what a treat with the 🎷 player really creating a magical ambience. I can not recommend highly enough. I initially thought it was quite an expense to add on to the cost of the holiday but it is worth every penny. Once you reached the 86th floor there was no time limit on your stay and even though the lifts were going up and down constantly with people (and it was busy) it doesn’t affect the enjoyment of the whole experience. We loved it. Thank you so much to everyone involved.",5.0,4.9886
9246,A must see,"Once in a lifetime you have to go up there and see the view. We chose the evening hours (after 7pm) to visit this attraction, it turned out to be a good thing. I purchased the tickets in advance online, there was basically no waiting in lines, after arrival we were up there in 20 minutes. It really worth the price (we had combined tickets for Top of the Rock and ESB)",5.0,4.6032

Expensive just to go up a tall building, but has to be done and is an experience.",5.0,3.862
9248,Thank you Tanya!!!,"My husband and I visited the Empire State Building on 10th April which was the last day of our trip. We had lots to cram in our last day and, as part of itinerary, we had pre-purchased an a.m. and p.m. ticket for the ESB. We arrived about 10am and were completely gutted when we saw the size if the queue. We were told it would take up to three hours to queue from the point we joined and we simply didn't have that amount of time to wait (if we wanted to fit everything in!). Then we met Tanya!!! Tanya appeared just at the moment we were considering leaving and we asked if we could upgrade to express tickets (Just for the day) to get us straight to the top - and get us straight to the top she did!!! Tanya told us to follow her and she took us straight through - we were first in line for everything and paying for the express tickets was the best extra dollars we spent. The lovely man in the ticket booth was struggling a little with upgrading us...but Tanya was there and sorted it all. She could not have been any nicer with it all too - Tanya's customer service was genuinely next level and did everything with a laugh and smile - nothing was too much trouble.

Yes, the ESB is a MUST if you're in NYC (it's iconic!) but Tanya was what made our trip that day. Without her, we'd have walked away and never got to experience life at the top - she made our day and our trip. THANK YOU!!!",5.0,4.9248
9249,Unforgettable!,"I had an amazing time there! Way more than the picts and historical banners inside the building, I enjoyed really much the view of NYC! I visited the ESB around 4pm, and could experience the breath-taking view of sunset in NY, although it was very windy and cold up there! So windy that I almost lost a sweater! It was tied to my purse and within a split second, it was gone with the strong gusts! Fortunately a woman saw it flying and catched it for me! I also purchased the tickets for Tacombi (Mexican restaurant near the ESB), and it was absolutely worth the price!! Strongly recommend both!!!!!",5.0,4.893

The elevator was quick to get you up there
If you can pick a sunny cloud free day it would improve the photos
Views are 360 degrees great all round",5.0,4.8402
9256,Save your money and avoid this nightmare!,"This was a cluster right from the start, the signage is terrible so you don’t know where to even get in line. The term “line” is used pretty loosely here. It’s a crowd that they funnel into a line to get tickets. There are kiosks, and only one employee helping people. There again is no signage that says if you have a NY pass, that is in fact your ticket. So again we waited in lines only to find out we didn’t need to. Then you gather again in a large group and funnel gown again to lines to the elevators to the 80th floor. When you get out you can look around and again, you guessed it! You get in another line. But again, there is little signage and you just figure out what’s happening. There are only a couple elevators that go to up to the 86th floor. When you’re ready to come down, there is another line to go to the 80th floor and the wait was about 30 minutes. You again get out and wait in another line to go the rest of the way down. We chose to take the stairs down to the 80th floor and beat everyone waiting for the elevators.
The view is simply amazing but for the 10 minutes you’re up there it wasn’t worth the cluster f@&k and hour wait to get up there. Save your money and go to the Top of the Rock, it’s well organized and also a great view!",2.0,4.961
9257,"A crowded, touristy event","We showed up with tickets and waited in line for about 45 minutes, moving from one area to another, before we were escorted onto the elevators. The first floor is an inside-only viewing station. We didn't stay long there, and got back into line and eventually got to the second viewing floor, where you can go outside. If you go out there, be warned that it's really crowded. I have a fear of heights (or open spaces, some would argue), and the idea of going out there with so many people just made me too nervous, so I took some photos from inside, through the window. We went at around sunset, and if I were to return, I would suggest going after dark, because I imagine that the view with all of the lights of NYC would be pretty fantastic.",3.0,3.0704
9258,Polite and helpful staff and great organisation,"Staff were polite and helipful, which turns out is very rare in NY! Staff were organised and quick to help organise the crowds so lines were kept to a minimum and wait time was reduced. We were up and down within an hour.

Staff were nice and helpful.
If visiting in the evening or later, remember it's quite windy and even cold up there.
Views are as good as in any tall building's observatory. Since it's an expensive experience, consider only one of them.",4.0,4.8402
9267,Night time thrills with minimal wait,"After spending nearly a week in NY we were getting fed up of the lines, waits and crowds so took the decision to purchase express tickets for the Empire State to avoid the lines in security and waiting for the elevators. This was worth it.

We got to the building at approx 10pm and the lines were minimal anyway, but the express pass was still worth it. We got plenty more out of the visit with the express passes and it took a level of stress out of the experience that we just didn't need.",5.0,2.5954
9268,Great views but too crowded,"Fantastic views from the top but the experience was marred by the lack of organisation. Visitors were herded and rushed through the security and up in the elevators only to find that at the top it was 3 deep, so difficult to get a good view and take photos. Coming down was even worse - it was claustrophobic as everybody was channelled into one narrow corridor to get the lift down, with no real organisation by the security guard at the top. They were still letting people up, and with no one way system there was a lot of pushing and shoving, and we had to queue for over 45minutes!! Uncomfortable and unsafe - just money-grabbing !!!!",3.0,1.487

9290,Poorly managed,"The building is gorgeous. The view is amazing. The crowds are obscene, and there is no effective crowd control. Top of the Rock gives you a ticket time, so it's busy, but still enjoyable. The Empire State Building just stuffs everyone up there. We were literally cheek and jowl the entire time. I finally managed to get to a place where I could see, and I was smashed into the side with some strange girl using my butt as an armrest, and that was definitely the highlight of the experience. I am not the kind of person who leaves bad reviews. I actually thought the staff were all very patient and helpful, but the management is incompetent. The situation is unsafe. Yes, they say to come at less busy times, but I was there pretty late in the evening, and it was still appalling. Having hordes of terrified people stampeding down narrow stairways is dangerous. Have people queue outside and regulate the numbers better. I'm afraid of what would happen if anything went wrong up there.",1.0,3.2538
9291,Still the best,"We have been to NYC several times and have also been to different from observation decks. I love Empire State Building the most by far.

The view, understandable, is amazing, with a panoramic view of NYC as one walks the perimeter of the floor. Fair warning: it is VERY COLD! Wear a hat, scarf, and gloves - you will be glad you did - as you will be able to enjoy the view for much longer. To think that this beautiful building - and it is truly beautiful - was built in such a relatively short period of time whilst preserving such quality in the craftsmanship is astounding. I would LUV to go back and do it all over again. This is an American gem of architectural genius.",5.0,4.9654
9305,Great View!,Good tourist sight. You do not have to go any higher that the 84th floor. The view is just as good from there. No need to pay extra to go higher. It was very windy when we were there so did not spend a lot of time outside but we still got good pictures. A lot of history was provided too. We did not have to wait long to get in. The staff was fine. Not overly friendly but pleasant enough. We did not buy ticket ahead and still did not have to wait long.,4.0,4.693

There are no signs explaining the procedure, where you should go or how long the wait will be. It took us about 1.5 hours of waiting. My son wanted to leave before we even got to the top. Everyone in line around us was confused as to what we were waiting for or if they were in the right line. People kept pushing and cutting in line. At the 80th floor there are steps you can take up instead of waiting in line for elevators but no one said that until we waited 10 minutes than everyone rushed to the steps and people were pushed and were tripping. At the top the view is great and you can see the Statue of Liberty which was a highlight for my son. It was still insanely packed and hard to find a good place to look out. I’m glad my son got to see the view, but I will never visit here again unless they change the process. It took us about 2 hours to visit and most of that time was waiting in lines with no seats or bathrooms in sight. If you can afford it do the express pass. They do take a family photo but not sure how much it costs to buy it.",2.0,4.864

9309,Great Time at Empire State Building,We took about two hours to tour the Empire State Building. We had VIP passes which we purchased for an extra $60 each. It was the best extra $120 that we ever spent. We bypassed all the lines of people to get in and were ushered to the front of every line to get to the elevators. The view from the top was absolutely gorgeous. We did it in the daytime but heard the night time view is spectacular. It was a great tour but I highly advise purchasing the VIP passes.,5.0,4.931

9311,My dream of this building was greater than the experience,Big great close-up with scaffolding upon the first floor so the only proper view is from a distance. The queue for the observatory was three hours so we swerved it.,2.0,4.2498000000000005
9312,Anniversary trip and first NYC visit,"In my opinion You can’t say you went to NYC (first time) without visiting this iconic land mark. It’s beautiful, you can summarize NYC architectural history in this skyscraper. Even though it no longer holds the title of tallest building in NYC it has its seniority and you need to respect the ranks. You need to visit it and enjoy the tours and the views both day and night. We used City Pass to visit the Empire and the booklet included both tours day and night. Go all the way to the top don’t be scared.",5.0,4.569
9313,Empire State Building,"We bought our tickets online direct with the Empire State Building before leaving the U.K which saved us queing when we was there. We was lucky it wasn't very busy when we visited last Friday. We got some amazing photo's from here, it's a must do.",5.0,4.711
9314,Breathtaking,Did the night view from top of ESB......WOW WHAT A VIEW on a clear night. Breathtaking and fantastic. I still can’t believe this structure only took 444days to build back in the 1930s. An unbelievable must visit attraction in New York.,5.0,4.86
9315,Iconic place to visit. Although Top of the Rocks is better,"There is no doubt this is a must visit on a trip to NYC. However I would say that Top of The Rocks is a better overall experience and the views are better.

Do the express ticket. The queues were insane!

Worth doing however.",3.0,3.6764

9317,Ok Trip,We recently went to the Empire State building it was just ok to be honest. Really busy lots of people and felt that just couldnt enjoy it as much due to all the people shame they dont limit the numbers or make you pre book to ease this a bit,3.0,3.624
9318,First Attraction,express ticket recommended for saving time. best to visit during sunset to see city in lights. nice place to be.,5.0,4.6632

9320,Amazing Architecture,"If you are visiting New York City, especially the borough of Manhattan, you must visit the Empire State Building. It is a costly attraction and a long wait but if you have the time, it is a great building to visit. It has a nice observation deck and you can get great pictures when it is not cloudy.",5.0,4.9142
9321,Don't miss it,Amazing views from this iconic building. This is a must for the first visit to NY. The only drawback is that there is no place to have a seat.,5.0,3.7636
9322,Not so express,"Paid extra money for the ""express"". It was anything but that. Poor sign and employee coordination. I also visited the new WTC tower on this visit to NYC, that was a much better experience. Designated lanes both going up and coming down. The express part of Empire only got us that way to the next level, I think it was the 33rd floor, then we snaked for about 45 minutes in a hot area filled with tourists who came to see the Manhattan skyline. At least the weather was good and we had good visibility.",4.0,4.6251999999999995
9323,Good experience,"Purchased the express pass but didn’t really need to use it. Even if we had used it, it would t have helped once we got to the 79th floor because everyone is moved to one line to get to the observation deck outside. It took about 15-20 minutes to get through that (and it was hot in there since everyone was dressed for the cold outside). Once outside, it was crowded but everyone worked nicely so you could see the sights. My kids enjoyed it- they were afraid at first but liked using the viewfinders.",4.0,4.8372
9324,First time experience,A sunny day meant a trip to the top of the ESB. We went early to avoid the queues. The views were amazing even though there were so many visitors but this didn't stop you seeing the views. Very well organized by the staff. Did not disappoint,4.0,4.7724

9326,Amazing Views,"Great views from The Empire State Building,with Manhattan at your feet! Didn't need to book in advance,but the queues were horrendous, obviously security takes a bit of time,but what doesn't help is the photos that are taken (that you have a choice to purchase at the end),the time could be greatly reduced if you could bypass this by having two queues maybe if you don't want your picture taken,but that is only my personal opinion!",4.0,3.4066
9327,A Must See,A must see in NY for any tourist. Line can be long long longer longest. Once inside more lines. Then more lines. Then bad moods. We went back at 3PM and there were no lines. No exit without manditory passing through gift shop.,4.0,1.7112
9328,Be prepared to queue... A lot!,"We decided to go there to watch the sunset. But the queueing to get to the top took over an hour. There was even a massive queue to get back down! We were packed in narrow dim-lit passage ways...

That was a shame, as it downplayed the whole experience.

The building is beautiful art deco inside. And the view was amazing. But all that queueing was a pain. Not anything I experienced at other attractions. Shame",3.0,4.2228
9329,Worth the queue,It's disappointing that the lower floors of the front facade are swathed in scaffolding (bit of an issue generally in Manhatten) and internal renovations mean you only see parts of the ornate vestibule. And the queuing for security and then the elevators is a bit chaotic. But the staff are very helpful and when you finally get up to the viewing platform Wow! Go after dark. Stunning.,4.0,4.7972
9330,It was lovely at night!,We had already been to Top of the Rock and seen great views so we decided to go to the Empire State Building at night. Lovely views of all the lights and no queues. However if you are just going to one then I would choose the day time when you can see more. Make sure it’s a clear day or views are badly affected (see the first photo). When we went at night it was very clear.,5.0,4.781
9331,The Climb to the Lookout is worth the effort!,"Even though the queue seems endless and the crowds are huge, it is worth the effort to scale the Empire State Building. I would recommend visiting the lookout in time for sunset as it is magnificent watching the skyline change from dusk to evening. Be ready for strong winds and cool temperatures.",4.0,4.8986

9334,Another Manhattan Iconic Building,Very few buildings define a city like the Empire State Building does in NYC. It’s beautiful from almost every vantage point. If you have the time during your visit go to the top. On a day like today the view is spectacular,5.0,4.7316
9335,The best view for NYC from top!,"Went up the elevator to the 108th floor and saw a breathtaking view of NYC from above, 360 degree view all around the city. Brought back the king kong movie and many more, spend more than two hours overlooking the amazing city !!!",5.0,4.652

9338,"Organised, friendly Staff, Iconic Location","Great visit to Empire State. Very friendly staff, organised so that it is in sections, therefore it never feels like you have to wait too long in a line. Plus as the numbers are limited, it does not feel too crowded at the top.

9340,Superb,"After time spent considering if we should buy a ""skip the line"" pass we decided against it and arrived at 8am with no queue at all. Around 3 minutes later we were at the top. The view is brilliant. All the staff were incredibly warm and welcoming, especially Christopher D at the top of the lift. They made you feel like you were the only visitor of the day despite the fact that we were just two of thousands. A really special memory. My advice would be to arrive early and avoid leaving it to the last couple of days of a visit as visibility may not be good so at least you should be able to see it on another day.",5.0,4.7742
9341,Get the express tickets!,"We visited during MA school vacation week so I am not sure how busy this typically is but on Tuesday the line was wrapped down streets and was 90 minutes just to get into the building. Then there were more lines for security, the elevators (there’s 2) and more. But, if you had express tickets you bypassed all of this! They are pricey but honestly worth every penny. With our express tickets we probably waited 10 minutes total.
It was very crowded at the top but the views were stunning. NYPD even flew by in a helicopter while we were up there and put on a little show for us and waved to the kids. A little extra that you might not see but my kids really enjoyed it.
Overall this was an expensive hour or so but we all enjoyed our experience, loved the views and would do it again if in the city.",5.0,4.9704
9342,Empire State Building,"While the view was fantastic and lived up to its billing, we were limited to the 86th floor observatory.

9343,A New York Landmark Revisted,"Took a moment to revisit a New York landmark. On a brisk afternoon, some friends and I, after having an amazing lunch went to check out The Empire State Building. I hadn't been since grade school, a VERY long time ago! I felt like a tourist in my own city... A must do excursion!",4.0,4.795
9344,Brilliant experience,"We booked the AM/PM ticket and we were very impressed by the overall experience (getting to the top and the views). We visited during the Easter holidays so it was getting busy, but the staff appeared professional and used to getting the tourists through and up to the viewing platform.
It is worth going early in the morning and then again late at night - please note it does get very windy at the top especially at night. However, it is well worth it to experience the views of NYC.",5.0,4.8624

9349,Loved the Experience,"Before our trip, we couldn't make up our mind which tower to go up. My wife had been to NYC before and done them all, so it was down to me. Some say go up the Rock as you can see the ESB, but for me I wanted to go up the famous one. Expectation can be the problem that leads to dssappointment, but I was totally impressed. We did the AM/PM thing and the experience was just great. It was quite windy in the morning visit, but that's what hats are for. The nighttime view was spectacular and we got some great photos.",5.0,4.873
9350,New York New York,My husband and I recently visited NYC and all I can say is that it lived up to everyone of our expectations and more!!!

9352,Beautiful Views of NYC at night,"My 13 year old son really wanted to go to the top of the Empire State building. My daughter and I were a bit indifferent, however, we ended up agreeing that it was one of the best memories from our trip. The 360 views were breathtaking. The downside is that the lines are long and there were a lot of people waiting to go up to the viewing area; think a big herd of cattle. :) However, it was worth the wait and when you finally get up there you actually appreciate that there are a limited number of folks up there with you which allows for great pictures and the ability to walk right up to the fence for an unobstructed view. It was a great experience and we are so glad we did it. I highly recommend this experience to others.",5.0,4.969
9353,Overwhelmed with visitors,An appalling experience visiting this world famous landmark. Bought tickets in advance. Might as well have not bothered. The security line took nearly an hour to reach the security check. With a disabled wife and two young grandkids there was no where to sit whilst waiting. There were no disabled facilities. Even when having passed the security checkpoint there was all in all another hours worth of queuing to get on elevators. Views from 86th floor were poor by modern standards with barriers and frames obscuring the views. Find somewhere else to go to see Manhattan from on high.,1.0,1.3416
9354,I live in walking distance.,"This Art Deco style building was once the tallest in the world.

I think you’ll be glad you did.",4.0,4.5565999999999995

9356,A lot of people,"Went I visit the observatory at the 86th floor, there was a lot of people, was not able to have a good view of the city. Too many persons at the same time, should have a time limit to visit and limit the amount of persons at the same time. Was not able to get goods pictures of the city.

Yes, folks, it's worth the money. The history of it, the view, the perspective it gives you on the city to establish your bearings and get a sense of direction. Just do it.

I was impressed how quickly we were able to get to the lifts and then the view from the 79th floor before heading on up to the 86th. The information boards were a real bonus when you could draw yourself away from the view from the windows.

Brought the express ticket, which allows you to bypass the crowds, but since we went during off-peak, it wasn't too crowded.

I really enjoyed myself. I haven't been here since I was on a school trip as a kid. We stopped at the 79th floor first. They doing some work on that floor but the views were awesome! A lot of hanging panels full of information about the building. We then went to the 86th floor, the outside deck. It was beautiful! The observation deck was closed for repair, so we couldn't go up there, but I could see all I wanted from the 86th floor.

We initially intended on doing this at night but opted to visit during the day and we we're not disappointed. Great views and great weather made for a great visit. It does get a bit warm waiting for the lifts both up and down so be prepared or have fluids on board should you visit in the warmer months. it also gets quite crowded on top as people jostle for the best views so be patient or take a selfie stick.

After visiting the ESB we chanced upon the 230th Roof Top bar on the way to the flat iron building and would recommend this establishment if you fancy a drink with the ESB in plain sight.",5.0,4.9722

The first lift (elevator) was inspiring, rather than having to wait and awkwardly avoid eye contact with strangers, you spend the journey staring at the cinematic ceiling, watching the progression of when it was first built. Breathtakingly stunning views from the top and a well stocked, varied gift shop. As you'd expect from any major US tourist attraction, welcoming, friendly and knowledgeable staff.

The only thing I can't advise on is the price, as it was included with our CityPASS. I can advise you to take a coat, hat and scarf as it is immensely cold up there.",5.0,4.8548
9396,Amazing!,"A really interesting visit, I was a bit sceptical about paying nearly $40 to go up in a lift but they make it really interesting with cool videos etc. in the lift whilst you're ascending to the different floors. You get to go to one of the lower floors first to look out of the windows where you can hang around and look about in your own time without being rushed around. When you're ready you go up to the 86th floor and can walk around either inside the observation deck or outside and the views were spectacular. We did it during the day and it was very cold/windy so wrap up warm! Would love to do it at sunset because the views I'm sure would be even more stunning.",5.0,4.9544
9397,Empire State Building at Night,It was beautiful and the trip up was enjoyable and interesting with the history of construction of the building . The views were amazing. It was late March and it was a little cold and very windy but I loved it.,5.0,4.849
9398,Unforgettable,"This building and the view always magic. Not too many time to wait. The ticket with the city pass include night and day visit, just perfect.",5.0,4.1438
9399,Hstoric place in the city and great to have some top-down photograpy,"Entering is quite expensive. Just to use the elevator and having a view, you pay a lot. Nevertheless, we enjoyed every minute of it. The 360° vie won New York is superb !",4.0,4.7998
9400,Great staff and fantastic views,The staff on site was extremely polite and well trained. The views as expected were amazing. Ticket price is a bit high and there are other buildings in NYC that can provide similar quality views.,4.0,4.4643999999999995

9402,Fantastic!,"We had a great visit, was expecting lots of queues but pleasantly surprised. Nearly bought Express tickets glad I didn’t waste my money.",5.0,4.7074
9403,Still a great place,"Even if Top of the rock or OWO are higher, the Empire State Building is an absolutely „must visit“ place",5.0,3.4046
9404,Overpriced and crowded,"Went to the top of the Empire State Building just because it was on the bucket list, but honestly it was underwhelming. Paid nearly $80 for two people to stand in multiple lines to get to the top. The views are great, full 360 around the top of the building but it was very crowded so you feel rushed moving out of your viewing spot after 30 seconds of looking. Can say I’ve done it, but would not spend the money again. Not worth it in my opinion.",3.0,4.8506
9405,Fun and cool,The Empire State Building is an architectural wonder and I had a wonderful time going to the top of the building. I have no complaints.,5.0,3.3062

9408,Check it Off Your Bucketlist,"The Empire State Building has been one of my favorite places to go in NYC. The view is just incredible. I was scared of heights, but the building feels so stable that I was okay. They also have many safety measures in place, so there is no chance of falling off.",4.0,4.6152

9411,Once in a lifetime,"We visited on a Sunday morning in April and the weather was stunning for the panoramic views. Got there before 10am and experienced no queues at all. All of the staff were very polite and friendly and kept everyone going to where they should be, even operating the lifts to keep things moving smoothly. The view is epic and the gift shop is well worth a visit",5.0,4.7356
9412,Iconic building - must visit!,The building speaks for itself and the view from the top is amazing. It was an easy visit for us - straight through security and up to the top in time for sunset. Would highly recommend,5.0,4.8742
9413,One-time worth seeing,"One-time must see experience. However, once is enough..and for 35 euros... High-speed lift was cool, roof-top view was clear but to high to see the streets. I would love to see actual interior of the skyscraper where the offices are.",3.0,4.7
9414,Building tour fees,Empire State Building imposes fees to visit 82 floor which is 39 usd for adult and 36 for childern but if the weather is clouded then spend your money you can’t see anything from top.,3.0,3.3558
9415,Empire State Visit,"This was so much more than just going up a building to see the views. All the staff were really friendly and helpful, making sure we knew that there weren't good views at the top (it was a really cloudy and overcast day) but it didn't matter as just going in the building and seeing the history was an experience in itself.
We returned for an evening visit when the cloud had lifted and manhatten was lit up - the views didn't disappoint.
A unique, friendly and fun experience.",5.0,4.897
9416,Wait is nuts .... felt like cattle,"Ok, if you want the view and experience, it’s worth it. BUT, buyer beware ..... we were told the wait was about an hour. It took 2 hours. The line snakes everywhere, often just into a large mosh pit that you have to navigate to get to the next area. Once you hit the elevators, great service by those stationed there. Don’t get fooled ... you go up one set of elevators to be dumped on the 80th floor and then more lines to get to the next set of elevators to go to the 86th floor.

I would not do it again .... even with how amazing it is up top.",3.0,4.7038
9417,Good views,But no explanation of what was where. In the Shard and Eiffel Tower there are maps showing you what you can see. Not here. Crowds okay as early on a Sunday morning. Very warm upstairs and remarkably little wind outside.,4.0,2.4956

9421,Views are wonderful,Had tickets booked in advance and had no problem with waiting for entry. Went on a sat evening circa 8pm so had a night view from top - it was wonderful and not too busy.

9423,Worth A Visit,Definitely worth prior booking and purchasing the optional skip the line tickets. Really easy to use no hold ups at all. It was not hugely busy when we travelled and we made sure that we got up early and did morning visit however I can imagine at peek times without skip the line you would spend more time queuing than actually experiencing the visit.,5.0,4.5682
9424,Empire State - go early,"We arrived just before 8am on a Sunday (jet lagged so had woken early anyway). We waited in the ground floor lobby and travelled up when it opened at 8. Almost no queues at this time, great views although a little chilly on an April morning. Great way to see Manhattan.",5.0,4.4692

9426,A night view of New York,"We chose to go up the Empire State Building by night to see the lights of New York as we had visited the One World Observatory by day. We pre-purchased our tickets at The Empire State Building (you have to go through security if you do it that way - but there are kiosks to purchase tickets just up the stairs inside - we couldn’t as the credit card was misbehaving!). There are no timed entries, you can buy your ticket and come back later if you want.
We went up about 7.30pm on a Saturday. It was busy but not chaotic and queues for the lifts were moving well. We actually took the stairs from the 86th floor to the observation deck. 7 flights but it saved waiting for the lift. The observation deck outside was busy but we didn’t find any problem finding a viewpoint as people are constantly moving. Definitely recommend a night view, everything takes on a different character especially the beautiful Chrysler Building.
It is pretty warm inside, especially with the crowds, so getting outside was really nice.
The staff were amazingly cheerful, hats off to them.",5.0,4.981
9427,Midtown Icon,"The Empire State Building is a must-see for visitors to Manhattan. This classic Art Deco beauty is the heart of New York (Midtown) and a true icon of the city, having been deemed the tallest building in New York from 1931 until 1961. The open-air observation deck on the 86th floor offers unobstructed views of Central Park and a panorama of the city that is as famous as the building itself. Well worth the admission cost.",5.0,4.725

9437,Brilliant views,Bought am/pm experience tickets. Well worth the money. As expected queue were long during the day but in the evening we went virtually stariaght through.

9439,The Air Up There!,"Having been in NYC for more than half of my life and ventured to over 25 countries since, surprisingly, this was my very first trip to the top of the ESB! I have been fortunate to catch views of this City I adore so much from so many vantage points, and yet there is something nostalgic about this perspective that will never grow old. A memorable ascent with my young niece in tow. Grateful for cooperative weather to catch all five boroughs and beyond. If folks come from all over the world for this experience, this certainly must be a New Yorker's right of passage!",5.0,4.8832

9445,Incredible,"Watched the sunset from the top and it was the most amazing experience. If you are going in the colder months, however, beware that you can't go up if the conditions of visibility are poor eg if there is fog (as you won't be able to see anything).

9448,Fantastic,"Amazing experience- the express ticket meant we went striaght through - no waiting no queues and we were at the top within about 10 mnutes.

The exhibition about the building of ESB is really interesting. I can just say - Go there!",5.0,4.895
9455,Stunning views,We visited after dark as it had been recommended. There were no queues and the views were breathtaking. It was a clear night and you could see the Statue of Liberty lit up in the distance amongst many other famous New York landmarks.

We had the NYC City Pass so we were able to walk past most of the lines and when we went on Friday morning there was no one in the line anyway. The views were great the first stop has a lot of history and windows then you take another elevator to get to the 86th floor which is the best view. I don't see spending a ton of time there. I did a walk around took pictures then I was ready to go. Although I am not the best at heights. It was really cool to see everything up that high.,5.0,4.9268

Very good security, staff are friendly and helpful. Several backgrounds set up for photograph. Remember to stand couple blocks away to capture the whole building up to the top. Lots of construction around the building so be patient with the mess.
The only complain is the address provided on the city pass is not the correct place to go. Security guards kept pointing us to go around other sides of the building. We ended up 180 degree away from the provided address, 50th Street, on another street. Other than this problem, we really enjoy the visit.",4.0,4.8835999999999995

The lift to the observation deck is amazing too with the video playing in the roof as you ascend (quite quickly with popping ears).
The view from the observation deck was amazing, but there were a lot of people up there, all trying to do the same thing, take photos of the view (obviously), plus taking selfies and trying to take photos of others with the view behind, when there isn't enough room anyway.

NYC looks a bit better under a blanket of snow I think ? Not virginal but cleaner ?? I noticed on this visit how engaged the staff were , all smiles, hellos & good wishes !

There is a glassed viewing area and up another elevator is the outdoor viewing area with solid wall to around 4.5 foot followed by railings above that. The views were exceptional and we have to give a big shout out to Gordon who answered our questions and took real pleasure in giving his stories of New York and experiences over the years. He made our visit extra special. We could have stayed there all night listening to him had our feet not been aching so much and we weren't so tired!

9496,Great experience up top,"Was a great experience at the top with a great view over the city, downstairs however wasn’t the same, very pushy street vendors trying to sell us fast track tickets at double normal price, kept telling us it was at least 1.5 hours wait to go up which wasn’t the case at all, doormen don’t seem to have much idea on where we had to go which I thought was bizarre as it’s their job to know, worth doing but avoid street sellers",4.0,3.4062

9505,human factor,"Building great, views fenomenal and breathtaking, old photos and presentation of architectural drawings great. Huge potential for the amazing experience !
Overpriced ( starting $36) and comercialised .
Stuff - many very dictatorial, unpleasant and rude and loud ,felt at few occasions like visiting prison or being at the check point at the airport ,not turist attraction - stains the experience and mood a lot. To clarify, few employees were happy looking ,smiling and pleasant, I want to thank them, they saved our visit .
On enterence photo was taken in front of a green wall, no explanation given, at the exit we were offered to buy the photoshopped fake looking photo for extra $ 26, rejected. Considering the price of the tickets ,should be given to everyone no charge. At the exit -labyrinth overpriced souvenir shop.",2.0,4.8582
9506,Good visit,"Toilet for men only one in the 86th floor which is to be tripled at least. For Women it should be doubled.

The fare of 39 USD is comparatively very higher than the other monuments/ tourist places in the world.
To be reduced.",4.0,3.0
9507,Stunning Views,"We went on a lovely sunny morning, the views are amazing you get a good view across the New York skyline.

Yes it's not a cheap visit if you do just the empire state building, but you can do visitor passes with loads of different companies offering multiple locations visits. The price is in line with what you will find charged at lots of pay visit places in Manhattan.

If you opt for the basic access expect to see Qs and wait lines but be patient and enjoy.

Would not be worth a quick rush visit you need to have an hour or so spare to enjoy.

Will deffo come back when in New York again.",5.0,4.8464

9528,Well worth a visit.,We arrived at 9.30am and there was a queue that was just moving in. The queue went in very quickly. We had purchased tickets through the 72 hour hop on hop off bus ticket so could choose either the empire state or top of the rock building. We scanned our bus ticket through the machines and were escorted to the lifts. The first lift took us to the 80th floor which gave us panoramic views through the windows at the city. We then walked round to the 2ns lift that took us up a further 6 floors to the 86th floor and were able to step outside to view the city. It was early so a tiny bit foggy but the view was still clear and beautiful. The trip up from the entrance till leaving the building took us about 45 mins. We could've spent so much longer there but it was very busy walking around with everyone wanting pictures so we got the pictures we wanted then left. The gift shop as you leave has some nice novelty gifts. The staff were friendly.,5.0,4.9418

9531,Breathtaking in more ways than one,"Had to visit this iconic building while in town. Staff is very helpful, there is someone in every corner to answer questions or greet you. There is a security checkpoint before you take the elevator. I had already pre-purchased my ticket so it was just easier to walk in. The elevator takes you only to the 79th floor, there is a small exhibition about the history of the building with surrounding windows. It's quite impressive just to sit there for a moment, you will need to have all the strength you've had in your reserves to follow the climb up six flights of stairs. I am in fairly good health, I thought until I had to go from floor 80-86 on foot. I guess I haven't read enough reviews and this took me by surprise. I made it to 86th after breaking a sweat and becoming short of breath. I gathered myself for a minute to exit the door into the observation deck. The view on all angles was breathtaking also on was a clear sunny day. I stayed up there for about two hours taking it all in and waiting for the sun to set, that's when it became a little more crowded but I never felt claustrophobic or anything. After I was done, I made my way down to the souvenir shop and bought two keychains and a couple of nice shirts to take home.",4.0,4.9116
9532,FUNDAMENTAL VISIT IN NY,"It was an unexpected visit due to I did not consider a nice and useful visit but the landscapes offered me a great view of NY (rivers, avenues, islands, skyscrapers…). Essential place to enjoy between 30 to 45 minutes (at least)...indoor and outdoor observatories.
Great!!!!",4.0,4.8492

9534,A joke,We paid to wait in a queue for over an hour. Get totally crushed into a corner. There’s no aircon- someone piped up about this and the concierge just laughed saying he was hot too! Forced into the elevator with far too many people. My friend nearly passed out. Far too busy and not worth the money. We chose those over the Rockefeller centre. Awful experience.,1.0,1.5544
9535,Awesome,"Went up once before in the daytime so this time wanted to have a night visit. At first a bit foggy but after the weather cleared up the views were fantastic and well worth it.
The only negative is that there is no where to sit down. We were up there for over an hour and my feet were killing me so I had to sit on the floor.",5.0,1.6696

After also visiting the 9/11 museum and a few other spots, this was the highlight of my trip. They just did some remodeling and the whole place was very clean and modern. Most of all, the views from the 86th floor are breathtaking. And, you can walk around the entire floor to get a 360 degree view. On a clear day, you can see for miles and miles. I'm really glad I did it and now I can say I've been to the top of the iconic Empire State Building!!",5.0,4.914

You cannot go to NYC and not see this!",5.0,4.9508
9563,Worth doing,"We went on a bright Saturday Morning in early April. We arrived at 09.30 and there were no cues getting into the building or getting up or back down in the lifts. Everything was very well organised. I'm sure at other time of the day/year there would be a lot of cuing as the barriers snake inside the building which we thankfully didn't get trapped in. For UK visitors NY is expensive given the current poor exchange rate. A basic evening meal for 2 $70, Beers $9 each. Alan",5.0,4.5652

9571,Lovely building,"The Empire State Building is best viewed from Top of the Rock. It’s an iconic building and great in photos.

9577,Iconic,"You can't go to New York City with visiting the Empire State building and that is what I did on my first visit, If I reviewed this when I went last year, it would have received 5 stars, but since having gone back and gone to the Top of the Rock, the view from there is the most amazing! That is purely because the view includes the Empire State building and lets face it that is the most iconic thing about the Manhattan Skyline isn't it! The queues were extremely long, unlike anywhere else I visited. I barely queued at all, except from here.",4.0,4.7128

9583,Extremely crowded with long lines but great view,"We bought tickets in advance and visited on a Saturday evening (around 8:30 PM). We were herded from one line to the next, and there did not seem to be any organization to the process whatsoever. At one point, we were just in a giant clump of people and had to physically push through the crowd to move forward. They really should consider timed entry or some other way to organize this as we had to wait for quite some time in so many lines. Once at the top, it was very, very crowded but of course, it was a beautiful view. There are other areas where you can catch a great view of Manhattan; I am not sure that a $40 ticket to be herded like cattle is worth doing again.",3.0,4.8964

Top Tip - Go early to avoid the queues - we got there for 0900 and went straight up.",4.0,4.5266
9587,Amazinggggggggg,"I just loved every aspect of this visit. The place is amazing, the views are amazing. I advice you to go up around 6-6:30 so you can have a look at the sunset and stay for the night when every light in the city gets turn on.",5.0,4.82
9588,Exceptional experience!,"From the moment you arrive at the Empire State Building, you are welcomed with a friendly service. The ushers are fantastic and go that extra step to make the experience special for you. It is a totally seamless process from entry into the building to getting into the lifts that take you up to the observation deck.
I would recommend paying that bit extra for Express tickets, that way you avoid the queues, which was great since we went at quite a popular time (sunset).
Once at the top, the views are stunning and yes, it is very busy, but the ushers keep you moving and it's never overwhelmingly full of people. We managed to get some fantastic photos, you just need to be patient.
The entire experience was exceptional and one I will never forget. Thank you.",5.0,4.9108
9589,Worth going over and over again,"This was my first trip to New York and so going to the Empire Stare building was pretty high on my priority list of things to do.

9594,A must,"Very beautiful views and detailed information on the construction process.
Store is very expensive, although almost all is made in China, and should carry publications in several languages not just English considering that visitors from several different countries visit it.",4.0,4.2722
9595,Great experience,"Great place. Excellent views of Manhattan. Very well organized, we didn' t have to wait, just enter the building and direct to the elevators, after being scanned by the security staff. I sincerely recomend the visit.",5.0,4.8804
9596,Iconic but poor value.,"Iconic, must-see attraction on a visit to NY. Fantastic views over the city. Not too crowded at the time of our visit (7pm) but $52 per person for an elevator ride is too much - especially when compared with Statue of Liberty at $18.50 & Radio City at $27. Both much better value",3.0,4.8835999999999995
9597,Sunshine on the Empire State,Wonderful views on a beautiful sunny afternoon. Not too crowded but still happy to have gotten the express pass.,5.0,4.789
9598,A good trip,"No queues, speedy admittance and little queueing for lift between levels. Great trip, shame about the wet and windy weather.",5.0,2.8968
9599,Express pass not worth the $,I wish I hadn’t bought my tickets ahead of time. I did not know you could buy your tickets at the building. I bought the express tickets and Thete were no lines. Not only were their no lines there was no one really paying attention if you had an express pass or not so I was stuck sometimes in the wrong line bc there was no clear direction for the express pass accept for right when you go in. So not worth the extra $ unless you wait to buy there and see if you need to buy them.,3.0,2.083
9600,Nice People and beautiful views,We had pre-paid passes and went early in the morning. The staff were kind enough to warn us there was fog and no view. We waited and went up at sunset.

It offers unobstructed panoramic views of New York City (or concrete jungle as it is called by locals) and beyond.
Every other structure looks so minicule or like a lego city when standing on the top deck of 86th floor (102 floor is closed for some renovations and is expected to be open to general public in july’19).",4.0,4.104
9604,As good as ever,"Last visited this building 30 years ago. Returned with my daughter on this trip for her 21st birthday. We weren’t going to bother with this because of all the talks of crowds and queues. However on Sunday we walked past at 5.30pm, there were no queues for tickets or lifts and we were at the top within 10 mins of buying the ticket. It was quiet at the top so we could easily walk around and take as much time as we wanted. We ended staying up there until the sun went down and got some night photos too. Well worth it and better than I remembered.",5.0,4.5248

9617,NYC classic: Empire State Building,"Buy fast pass!
Go at sunset!
Bring your camera!
Felt like we were taking part in a special tradition!
Great fun!
Would not recommend the upgrade to top overlook - expensive without much added value- unless you are trying to replicate a scene from a movie!",4.0,4.817
9618,Incredible view and interesting history lesson while you wait,"On the day I went, luckily there was no lineup. I was able to walk right in, buy my ticket and walk right into the elevator. I had my own elevator to the main observation deck. It wasn't too busy and I was able to get lots of pictures before heading to the top deck, where I went outside and took many more pictures. It was overcast, which might explain why it was not busy, or maybe I was just lucky. Regardless happy I stopped in here.",5.0,4.6352
9619,Excelent!,"Definitely a must if you are visiting New York! I had a regular ticket, where were no lines at all at security or elevator. Great!",5.0,4.6434
9620,Late night,"We arrived in New York late at night and because of the time difference we were wide awake and were looking for something to do and the Empire State Building was still open.
We decided to go and it was the best idea ever. There was cues but because of the time of day they were a fraction of what they would be during the day.

The views from the top are stunning but the amazing thing is that you can hear the hustle and bustle of the city.

Stunning!!",5.0,4.9088

Only 2, not the 3 we took last time.. Show up early morn and you will not have to wait for an hour or two like we did last visit.",4.0,4.6346
9626,Daughter loved it,"2nd time to the ESB, first time at night. Definitely recommend this time of day. Better view and the lines were MUCH shorter! Enjoyed the guy playing sax at the top floor, kind of just brought the whole experience together. It is a bit pricey, even for NYC when you compare it to other attractions and for what it is, but still a worth while experience",4.0,4.7524
9627,Great,"I really didn’t want to visit the ESB. But as it was my daughter’s birthday I agreed to accompany her. Well : it was amazing - the views, the architecture. Probably I will go back next time.",4.0,4.7908
9628,Much hyed but worth it,"As iconic as the Empire State is of the city and its rich history of skyscrapers, it is still impressive beyond its reputation. The movement to the top is efficient and the views are wonderful, especially of a clear, sunny day. If you are planning to do the Top of the Rock as well, go here in the morning and the other at dusk. The sun off the East River is magic and lights the Chrysler Building beautifully.",5.0,4.9586
9629,Sunset from the Empire State Building,We went on the evening of the day we landed to make sure we packed in as much as we could. We managed to visit around sunset which was stunning. 1st April it was freezing up there! Didn’t have to queue too long. But check time of year and time of day. And of course weather forecast. Don’t want to go up there if you can’t see anything! The ticket can be used any time you’re not tied to a specific day/time.,5.0,4.016
9630,Some advice,I always hesitate to take visitors to the Empire State Building because of the lines. Some advice - go in the morning. We got there around 11:00 am. Book tickets online. Stay away from spring break and summer if you can. We had a great visit.,5.0,3.9176
9631,Birthday trip,"We used our Explorere pass and we decided to visit all three towers on our trip this week, and have to admit that this was our fabourite, the views were amazing, I have some lovely panoramic shots. We went during the day and there was no queue early in the morning.",5.0,4.604

9642,The Grandest Skyscraper of them All,"The Empire State Building ruled New York and was the tallest building in the world when it was completed in 1931. With its wedding cake structure, ornate Art Deco style and lobby, it is the most handsome skyscraper in the world. I visited it recently with my brother and relived its 88-year history when I saw the engineering and architectural drawings of its construction and its steady progress skyward. A skyscraper is now defined as a building of 40 or more stories and 492 feet. This building topped out at 1,250 feet and reached 1,472 feet if you count the antenna. In 1991, when it turned 60, I wrote a feature about it for Sky-Delta that I am very proud of. In my mind it is a microcosm of New York: unsurpassed in all the world.",5.0,4.7606

9653,Not so breathtaking,"The view is lovely but not worth $38 , there’s so many people trying to go to the top and so many queues..and once you’re up there you probably won’t stay for too long .
I’d definitely recommend going in though , the building looks so luxurious on the inside .
One world trade centre building is meant to be way better as it’s actually a bit taller and you can see the Empire State Building from it 😊",4.0,4.8448
9654,Empire Visit,"Wow!! We made it there early and managed to be one of the first up the top, everything was so smooth and staff really knew what they were doing. Very enjoyable visit. Still the best observation deck in New York!!",5.0,4.8688

9656,Perfect Views of NYC,"A trip up to the observation deck at the Empire State Building is something you will never regret doing. The views over the entire New York area are spectacular. You get a 360 degree view of Manhattan and can then see all the other areas surrounding Manhattan Island.

9661,My son will remember it for entire childhood!,"I’m so glad that I took my 11 year old son to the top of the ESB. We took a quick 5 minute subway MTA Ride from Times Square and hopped off at 34/Harold’s Square. Was a planned trip to the inside of the building but LAST MINUTE he decided that he wanted to go up to the 86th floor.

Line was about 10 minutes on a Friday night at 9pm without express. We didn’t purchase anything in advance, just when we got there. After getting to the 80th floor indoor viewing area, there is another elevator OR stairs to get up to 86th floor. That is where the wait is, to get to 86th.

It was worth the 15 minute wait once we got to top. We stayed up there for about half hour and even watched a gentleman propose marriage to a women with a ring and all.

My son enjoyed the view from the free telescopes that are available for zooming in on things like the Statue of Liberty.

Cost after all that was about $80...",5.0,4.9492

9664,Empire State Building Tour from top to bottom.,We did the Premium Experience because we waited until we were in New York to buy them. The tickets were expensive but the experience was worth the cost. Our guide Siobhan was fantastic. You don't have to wait in lines and she provided an all encompassing history of the Empire State Building. We expected great customer service while we were with Siobhan but what really stood out was even after we were done with the tour the staff was very friendly and helpful. It was a great experience.,5.0,4.968

In addition instead of charge the family individual better to have family of 4 examples 2 adults and two kids something like that bundle price",4.0,4.6048
9679,Worth a Visit,"In my opinion, you can’t explore New York without checking out the views from the Empire State Building. We were there early so no line for us at all. Everyone was nice and efficient! The view was gorgeous. You do have a great view of Top of the Rock. Certainly feel higher up at the Empire State Building.

I felt the views were about the same, but glad we did both!",5.0,4.8574

We had great views over new your and New Jersey and were able to see where my daughter and grandsons stay.

Getting in was a tad bit confusing as there’s a specific entrance that you are meant to go into for the sight seeing and it isn’t clearly labeled. You sort of just wander around and ask people where to go until you get there. Other than that we absolutely loved it.,4.0,4.755

9721,Classic tourist destination but wonderful to experience,"During our previous trip to NYC we went to the Top of the Rocks rather than the Empire State Building so on this visit we decided to go to the Empire State Building. We pre-purchased ""skip the line"" tickets which weren't cheap, $260 for our family of four but were worth paying the bit extra to skip the lines. We tried to go the day our tickets were booked for but it was a rainy day in NYC and the staff at the Empire State Building advised we come back the next day as the view would not be good but they would also honor our tickets. And they did. All the staff we came into contact with were lovely and friendly, apart from in the shop where they weren't quite as friendly. This tourist attraction is pretty classic but we were so glad to go there and to think we have been to the top of this iconic building. You have security to go through, but this was pretty quick. I wasn't sure how I'd handle the heights but it wasn't bad at all. You take a very quick lift to the 79th floor which is fully enclosed with complete views of NYC and then you can take another lift to the 86th floor. Our daughter who doesn't like heights stayed back on the 79th floor but she actually would have been okay as when you enter the 86th floor it is fully enclosed with complete views of the city and walking outside is optional but it all feels very secure. The views are simply wonderful and we were all glad to have been to the Empire State Building.",5.0,4.9918

We wanted to see the sunset so we came around 5:30 and went up to see New York in the daylight, then we waited for the sunset. The cool thing is that we had the chance to see also the sight during the night and it’s worth! I’ m glad we went there for the sunset so that we could see three different sights of the city.

9734,"Iconic, but still not worth $100+","My 9 & 11yo sons really wanted to go. We purchased tickets there, with no waiting on a Friday morning. Security was tight, but no more intense than an airport. Lots of displays to look at on the way to security, just in case you are in line for awhile.

You take two separate elevators to get to the outdoor observation deck. It was very windy the day we were there. My boys were ready to go after 15 minutes, if that. We looked out, pointed out different landmarks in every direction, took a few pictures and that was it. The whole thing was very underwhelming.

The Sears/Willis Tower in Chicago does a better job, although that is all indoors.

I can't see doing it ever again (and only did it this time per my kids' request). It's just not worth it, especially since there are so many other awesome things to do in NYC and for much less and you enjoy those much longer. Save your money and grab a window seat on your flight in or out of NYC for free!",2.0,4.9648
9735,Construction Ruins the Tour,I went to the Empire State Building years ago when I moved to New York. My parents were visiting town and I wanted to show them the Empire State Building. I remembered an interesting guided audio tour with videos. This time it was much more expensive and there were just a few posters of the history. I saw there was construction so assume that's why tour was subpar this time. The view was still beautiful. I would recommend waiting until the construction is done if you can.,2.0,4.6884

There were headphone symbols on some of the signs on the photographs on the floor where we were to get in line for the elevator to the rooftop viewing area. However, Idid not see any headphones available, nor did I see anyone with them. This is the only reason I didn't give the attraction the top rating. Otherwise, the views were spectacular.

9805,Worth to visit dah and night,"I visited the Empire State Building at evening working day. There’s not lots of people so that it’s took half and hour waiting. The evening view is gorgeous, can see the whole manhattans. I believe the day time view is breathtaking as well.",5.0,4.6884
9806,Wonderful AM/PM experience,"This is one of “must see” in New York. We had the AM/PM experience, which is really worthy of the extra cost, because both of the views, day and night, are absolutely special and breathtaking. The stuff of the building was perfect, everyone was smiling. And because of the not so good weather (it was cloudy and windy) it wasn’t crowded at all - one of few places were bad weather can actually improve whole experience.",5.0,4.8208
9807,Worth every penny for the 86th floor open air view,"While the 102nd floor is higher, it’s behind glass and there’s not a significant difference in the photos I’ve seen from that view. The 79th floor view was a behind glass and when I got to the open air view of the 86th, it was no comparison. The renovation of the lobby, faithful to the early era style was thoroughly impressive. But back to the observatory: to feel the wind, the cool air, hear the sounds of the city and have only the safety barrier between you and the city was a sensation I’ll always remember. I was there about midnight. Plus marks for how it looked at that hour.",5.0,4.6148
9808,Epic visit and great staff!,We were blown away from start to finish at this iconic building. The staff were really helpful and because we got there before 9am we never had to wait in line. Had such a great time and of course the views were amazing,5.0,4.7998

9812,360° NYC view,"Although the Empire State Building is considered touristy and a cliche, so glad we decided to visit. The crowd was from all over the world and the employees were unfailingly welcoming and helpful. The views were excellent and the gift shop had everything you could possibly want to remember your trip. We even bought the photo op offered by the ESB. It was perfect. Use the red carpet service as it sure made our trip easier. Although the ESB is well known, it is most deserved !",5.0,4.9582
9813,She Said Yes - Again!,"I never did the marriage proposal thing the right way over 40 years ago, so on our 40th wedding anniversary weekend I took my bride to the 86th floor observatory with a ruby and diamond ring in my pocket and when we were out on the open air observation deck facing south on a beautiful sunny and breezy Saturday I got down on one knee and asked her if she'd marry me all over again. She said YES! Couldn't have been a better visit.",5.0,4.773

9815,Empire State Building on a windy day,"Even though our schedule brought us to the top of the Empire State Building on a really windy day, we thoroughly enjoyed it. Seeing the city of New York from this vantage point is unparalleled. The elevator takes you to a window enclosed observation floor where you can look out across the city and then get on another elevator that takes you to the 86th floor's Observation Deck. Usually you can find a corner where there isn't a tremendous wind to take your pictures. All four compass points have glorious views. But if you go when the wind is a little too much, you have the option of staying inside and still having a terrific view.",5.0,4.7143999999999995
9816,DAYLIGHT TO DUSK,"We went to the Empire State Building at the end of the day to catch the views in the daylight and for the sunset...it was amazing watching the city light up.

9821,old school professionalism,"When we went to the 86th floor, it wasn't crowded, and it was a beautiful, sunny day (if a tad chilly).

I don't know if we got lucky or if that's a great time to go, but, we were prepared to wait and they have space set up for long lines, so, I think we got lucky. The outdoor viewing area was very cold and windy, but, the views were amazing!",5.0,4.8740000000000006

9834,Blown away,"This had to be the most amazing experience, we arrived at about 8.30am and walked straight in no queues and went up to the first stop and marvelled at the views. Then up to the outside viewing,it was freezing cold,but worth every nose biting wind blow.",5.0,3.9508

When you get there - amazing views of the city just unfolds in front of you. It’s my favourite building for NYC skyline!",5.0,4.9186
9836,VIP Tour - Worth Every Penny!,"We recently had a fantastic experience at the Empire State Building. Gerard was our personal tour guide and did a wonderful job and made our visit a complete pleasure. He told us he was a 19 year veteran and his knowledge of its history was immense and could answer any question (from two librarians). The pride he took in his job and satisfaction in sharing the building with others was apparent. Also, every staff member we came into contact with was extremely friendly. Bottom line. Is it expensive? Yes, but we'll never forget the experience. Thanks so much Gerard!",5.0,4.9142
9837,An Institution,"A building of such fame and history that we had to visit on the morning of our final day in NYC and a great cap on a great trip.

I definitely advise going early when it opens during the week. We got there at 08:15 and went straight up. No queues.

Looks like Disney with all the queuing systems for later in the day and weekends. Be early for sure.

Great views in every direction. Open to the elements at the top, it was chilly so wrap up in the colder months.

We took the helicopter trip a few days ago but this gives another perspective and I’m happy we went",5.0,4.9056
9838,Must Do!,"Got to the Empire State for when it opened at 8am in the morning. No queues and first ones up the elevator. Fantastic views on a beautiful, crisp morning. Must do if you’re in NYC.",5.0,4.486
9839,Great views,Great views from the 86 Floor but alas the 102 Floor was closed on the day we visited - well worth a trip (but a little expensive),4.0,3.9534000000000002
9840,Beautiful at Night,We went up the Empire State Building on a Monday night about 9 pm. It was a beautiful night and a beautiful view. There were no line so we were able to go right up without any wait. The staff was friendly. We liked that you could actually go outside as compared to the One World Observatory where you are always inside. We recommend this as a night stop on your tour of New York.,5.0,4.8338
9841,Wonderful view,It was so wonderful to see New York from above! We enjoyed an amazing view with some clouds only. You can really see the entire city.,5.0,4.8412

9845,Go at night!!,"We decided to go after a hockey game
... about 11pm. FABULOUS idea. NO line at all and LOVED seeing the city at night. We spent about an hour as we saw it all because there were only about 15 people there!! A great experience! Look around at the building itself. Beautiful architecture. Must be a requirement to work there that you are a kind, lovely person because the staff there was amazing!! Thanks for a great time!!",5.0,4.9764
9846,"Cold, windy, but well worth it.","We went on a freezing and extremely windy day. Going outside was hilarious as the wind literally pushed you around. The views are stunning and if you're not brave enough to face the cold, there is an indoor viewing area.",5.0,3.5574
9847,Go.,"We took our trip up early on the day, on a weekday. Spent no more than 5 minutes at any ""wait"" point (security, elevator to 79, elevator to 86, coming down). Had plenty of room to view the city. Didn't feel crowded or rushed.",5.0,1.8282

Thank you for a great experience on my visit.",5.0,4.8919999999999995
9851,A must,"We had amazing views, it was a lovely clear day could see for miles, lots of information about what you can see. You cant go to NYC and not do this",4.0,4.7614
9852,Great view,"We had a great time at the Empire State building. We bought passes prior to our trip. We went with 10 adults and really had no wait lines at all. We went on a Thursday afternoon around 2 pm. Never felt rushed and we were all able to get on the same elevator to the top. Take your good camera-there are amazing shots in any direction. Take your NYC map to compare what you are seeing, or even better yet, stand near a tour guide and you will hear so much about what you are seeing",5.0,4.8378
9853,Empire state,"After then I visited the tallest building of New York since 1931, the Empire State Building! It is an American cultural icon. It is is a 102-story Art Deco Skyscraper. It is an office building and an observation Deck in mid-town Manhattan.It is amazed to know the fun fact that 10,000 to 20,000 work inside the Empire State building. The view from the top floor is mesmerizing and the ticket cost $34 for an adult and $27 for a child.",5.0,4.6442
9854,It was Nice...BUT crowded...,If you go to NY you have to visit the empire state building..For sure..It was a good One time thing! a Little on the pricey side but well worth it when you get to the top!,5.0,4.6574
9855,A solemn experience,"This museum and its exhibits are not to celebrate a time in our culture, but to remember those who lost their lives on that September day, and those who tried to save them. Some heartbreaking things here, but some uplifting things as well. All in all, a tribute to those who were taken from us, and to the indomitable human spirit. Let's roll.",4.0,3.0264
9856,Classic tourist attraction,"A bit tricky to find the right entry door due to construction of adjacent business but otherwise a great experience of this iconic building! Strongly suggest to get express tickets, no line, no waiting. Great exhibit about how the building was constructed. Plan about 1.5 hours to spend there.",5.0,4.769
9857,Break in NY,"It was fine, it was a pity that we didn't have the chance to go up to the highest floor - i hope next time in NY.",4.0,3.3852
9858,What a building!,"It’s iconic and rightly so, the whole experience from photo opportunity at the foot of the stairs to the ride in the elevator to the view from the 86th floor is amazing. The only downside was the fact that we had been bought a trip to the 102nd viewing platform and it was closed for renovation.",5.0,4.3616
9859,LONG Lines.. But worth the wait if you're into views,"There's always a line, so if pressed for time buy the gold express pass. But if you can stand the wait, it becomes well worth it to stand out on the observatory deck of this immense skyscraper. Filled with tons of history too.",5.0,4.2248
9860,Sunset From The Observation Deck,We had some issues with the tickets we bought via an Explorer Pass but the staff at the Empire State Building were very kind and did their best to help. We got a chance to watch the son set from the observation deck of one of the worlds most iconic buildings. You cannot miss this experience!!!,5.0,4.9315999999999995
9861,Awesome night views of New York/New Jersey,"We pre-purchased our tickets and went on a Sunday night around 9 p.m. expecting to wait in lines and maybe get to the observatory deck after about an hour. What a pleasant surprise that if one was willing to walk 10-20 flights of stairs (can't remember the exact number...takes an able-bodied person who exercises less than 5 minutes), the only line we had to wait for took less than 3:00.

I would definitely say that if you aren't fit (read: haven't been doing some sort of movement on a regular basis beyond just day to day walking, the stairs aren't a good option). They are steep and not ventilated...several people were pausing on the landings to catch breath and give quads a rest. However, for anyone who is a casual jogger/active person without health issues, do it to avoid waiting for the second elevator.",4.0,3.9824
9862,Boring,If you have never been to New York and feel the need to say you went to the top of the Empire State Building then to. Other wise you may be better off going to the top of One World Trade which is taller and more updated. This excursion is no frills. Nothing exciting. Just a view. And it’s not worth the $38.,3.0,3.9554
9863,Worth checking out,"I have been to the observation deck several times previously. This time I just went in the building and walked around and took a bunch of photos of the building itself. I love its art deco nature and its views of course. I actually like the view at Top of the Rock better as that view is closer to Central Park. Plus from there, I get this iconic building in my photos.

Still well worth checking out and lots of great photo ops also.",4.0,4.9104
9864,SIMPLY THE BEST,"It was an amazing experience. I had a lot of fun and this is by far my favorite place in New York City. The view from the top is the best one I have ever seen in my life and the atmosphere is unique. I hope to come back as soon as possible, maybe by night.",5.0,4.9168
9865,Amazing,"The Empire State Building has always been my favorite place in NYC and after getting engaged up there in January, it will always hold a special place in my heart!",5.0,4.6536
9866,GREAT VISIT,"It was a good experience, I went with my mom and we went up at night. Even when it was super windy we enjoyed the view, it was beautiful, the entire city and all the lights were amazing. Point against, the grid outside and the glass inside, I know its for secutrity and for the wind but it made so difficult to have a good pic, maybe at morning that'll work better, I´ll have to try again some time. Definitly, I have to go back!",5.0,4.838
9867,Amazing,So much history here. If you haven't been it's a must see. The Hudson river is a wonderful reflection of Gods Glory,5.0,4.604
9868,Great view,"After 9 times in NY, I decided to go up for the view and its worth it. So many ti=things to see in NY but its awesome.",5.0,4.5928
9869,What Happened to the Exibits?,"I have been here before and there were lots of exibits in the line area as well as an audio tour that were mostly missing on this visit. I could tell from the change in where you enter that things are in transition for visitors. It was just disappointing that most of the very nice museum information I saw a few years ago were no longer able to be viewed now that I was here with my family.

The trip to the top in the elevator was great, (you ride in two elevators in both directions) the views were awesome, and of course the architecture and iconic landmark make this a must see place! We couldn’t resist buying the family photos they took but the gift shop items were overpriced. Make sure to look at the beautiful entrance which is where the visit now ends.",4.0,4.9088
9870,Incredible!,"One of my favorite NY experiences. We got up there right before dusk, saw the sun set, and the city lights slowly coming to life!",5.0,4.0186
9871,Great View - but Over-rated,"We went to the top deck and while the view was impressive, it was too pricey (over $30 per person) for the trip. The first stop gives a nice overview of how the Building was developed, the time spans, and who was involved in the design and construction. The second stop was an outside observation deck which provides a nice view of the whole city.
We heard the same view could be obtained from other rooftop restaurants or bars and we should have taken their advice. To much money for a moderate experience.",4.0,4.486
9872,Well????,"Honestly, this was waaayyy over priced. We couldn't go to the very top due to construction, but, from what we heard, it wouldn't have been worth the price difference to go to the very top even if it would have been open. There are plenty of opportunities in many big cities to go to the top floors of tall buildings to see the city by day or night. If you visit the ESB during the day, you end up seeing a lot of haziness from the pollution. Overall, in our skyscraper-filled society, the ESB is just not as big of a deal as it used to be.",3.0,4.6982
9873,Amazing Views.,"In my opinion if you want amazing outdoor views of the city, this is it. Did miss the sunset from the top, will definitely try to make that next time I’m in the city. Thanks empire for a great ending to a great day.",5.0,4.918
9874,Wonderful views,We loved our ESB experience. We used the New York Pass and went in the late afternoon and very little queues for security. There is plenty of information to read on the lower floors before getting to the 86th floor observatory. The views are amazing and even better the telescopes are free unlike the top of the rock. I would definitely recommend this experience!,5.0,4.9288
9875,Great view & iconic building,"Myself and my husband went to visit the building in the evening to see new york at it's best. There are so many great things to learn about this building: the record time of construction, the method used to build it, the amount of people involved...
But the greatest thing about it is the 360° view of this great city.
You can go up for free with the New York Seightseeing Pass.",5.0,4.9478
9876,Fantastic,"I love the New York skyline and any chance to view the city from high or afar, I was there. Just like the Top of the Rock, the views are stunning. We were lucky to go up on our nicest day and it was so peaceful. Slightly different views from the top of the rock as you can’t see Central Park as clearly but that wasn’t a problem for us in the slightest.",5.0,4.7044
9877,Terrific Views.,"Worth the trip up to the top. The weather wasn't kind to us, rather cloudy and watery so the views were a bit obscured but enjoyable all the same. We braved the weather to walk around the top outside, bit blustery to say the least but couldn't not doo it as we were there.",5.0,4.7418
9878,Waiting on a Sunny Day.,"I've accompanied several groups of visiting relatives and friends to the observation deck of the Empire State building. Sometimes tight schedules make it difficult, however I strongly recommend avoiding cloudy days or nights to experience fantastic views. No matter how much time you spend in line or how thrilling the elevator ride can be, the sunset and or bright lights of the greatest city in the world is the ultimate!",4.0,4.8824000000000005

See Rockefeller Center as well.",5.0,4.9108

9895,New York Icon,"This is a must see in New York City. I purchased tickets ahead online which saved a little time and would definitely help on a busy day. We didn’t bother with the extra $100 for express pass and we lucked out and the lines were minimal when we were there. That being said, you still walk through a LOT of lines as they get you to multiple elevators to reach the 86th floor. The express pass would be a total waste of money on a day like this. The view is amazing from the inside and outside viewing area. It was crowded at the top and freezing the day we went so we alternated between inside and out. The staff were friendly and helpful. When you come back down there is a family photo you can buy for $26-$36 and a huge gift shop that you have to wind through to exit. It felt a little Disney-esque, but how can you skip it?",4.0,4.798

The views were amazing! The only upper deck was closed due to construction.

This was another drive-by visit.",4.0,4.7602

9920,A MUST SEE!,Wanted to take my daughter to the top for her first visit to NYC. We went early evening just as the clouds were rolling in. Went to purchase tickets when one of the many ushers they have working there advised us the view was going to be very limited at the top. I super appreciated his honesty so we didn't waste our money. Set the alarm for first thing in the morning and went back. No line. No waiting. It was wonderful! The views of course are breath taking. I'm super afraid of heights but being outside on the 86th floor observation deck didn't faze me. Definitely worth the price!,5.0,4.6494

9934,Great views,"Visit with my friend , I would recommend going to the Empire State 20-30 minutes before sunset as it gets very busy around that time there is a long queue and airport style security checks . Me and my friend had New York explorer pass which was great and would recommend however the website suggested that the Emprie state enables you to queue jump but didn’t happen because think this was not possible due to the time of day we went.

9942,Unbelievable Views,"We visited at night and although it was very windy and and exceptionally cold it was worth the visit. The viewing deck is large with plenty of space to take some amazing photographs.

Security was a little slower than TOTR and the staffs are not as friendly and approachable. No queues and minor waiting time, we were on the viewing deck within minutes.",5.0,4.0120000000000005
9943,Breathtaking,"Really enjoyed our visit to the Empire State Building the views are just amazing. We were there on a Friday morning just before 10 am there was no queues. We purchased our tickets from some city sightseeing reps that were located near Macy’s we got 3 locations for $89 dollars.

The lift to the 80th floor was fast and played a video about the Empire State Building as we went up. It was a lovely morning the sun was shining however it was very windy once we got onto the observation deck so wrap up.

The views were spectacular it’s a must see in New York I would recommend a visit to the Empire State Building.",5.0,4.8624
9944,No seating,"We went around 5pm in a Friday expecting a line. We walked straight up to the ticket kiosks though. Short line for security and then the elevator, but we got up faster than expected. Everything is new and very nice compared to my visit 20 years ago.

There is an open, enclosed room at the top with glass windows on one side -no seating. My kids were very tired and complaining, and we wanted to wait until sunset since we arrived an hour too early. We all sat on the floor only to have an employee come through and tell us there is no sitting on the floor. It was freezing and very gusty outside -MUCH colder than street level. Come prepared for it to be windy.

The views just before and after sunset are prettiest IMO. Just try to hit the timing right and be prepared to be fussed at if you try to sit down. They did that several times in the hour before sunset. Really, they need to provide seating as well as some sort of labeled photos so you know what’s what in the view. There is no sort of information provided. The binoculars around the viewing platform are free though. That is nice.",5.0,4.8546
9945,A great observatory,"The empire state building is the second tallest building in Manhattan and the tallest in midtown Manhattan so everything is visible from the tower- the uptown, the downtown the east side the west side even Brooklyn Queens and the eastern part of New Jersey. The observatory has a lower desk that serves also as a museum for the building of the empire state building and a upper deck 360 degrees observatory. You are first brought to the lower deck so be sure that You visited the observatory itself/ I also suggest that a visitor should come before sunshine when it is still light but soon will be darkness so it ll be possible to film both the dark time and the light time and the changes between them",5.0,2.5902

We visited in March and arrived around 3pm, with the queues being minimal and we were fortunate with the weather, however recommend warm jackets and hats if you are going outside. Take your time to read the story boards as this give a great background to the construction. It is expensive per person but in my view it was worth it and less expensive than a helicopter ride and a great way to view the city.",4.0,4.9190000000000005

There was also fewer people around at night so I could really enjoy the view and get some great shots. The staff were all very friendly - including security which did prompt one person in my day visit to ask why the TSA couldn’t be as organised, very quick ( they moved us fast) - and very effective - and yet still friendly.
